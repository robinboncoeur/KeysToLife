The Nature of God
*****************


Never Be Cast Out
=================

*Whoever comes to me I will never cast out.* – John 6:37, ESV.
 
Is there any instance of our Lord's casting out one who came to him? If there be so, we would like to know of it; but there has been none, and there never will be. Among the lost souls in hell there is not one that can say, "I went to Jesus, and He refused me." It is not possible that you or I should be the first to whom Jesus shall break His word. Let us not entertain so dark a suspicion.
 
Suppose we go to Jesus now about the evils of today. Oh, this we may be sure—He will not refuse us audience or cast us out. Those of us who have often been and those who have never gone before—let us go together, and we shall see that He will not shut the door of His grace in the face of any one of us.
 
"This man receiveth sinners," but He repulses none. We come to Him in weakness and sin, with trembling faith, and small knowledge, and slender hope; but He does not cast us out. We come by prayer, and that prayer broken; with confession, and that confession faulty; with praise, and that praise far short of His merits; but yet He receives us. We come diseased, polluted, worn out, and worthless; but He doth in no wise cast us out. Let us come again today to Him who never casts us out. – Charles Spurgeon

God Freely Gives
================

*He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?* - Romans 8:32
 
If this is not a promise in form, it is in fact. Indeed, it is more than one promise, it is a conglomerate of promises. It is a mass of rubies, and emeralds, and diamonds, with a nugget of gold for their setting.
 
What can the Lord deny us after giving us Jesus? …If we need all things in heaven and earth, He will grant them to us: for if there had been a limit anywhere, He would have kept back His own Son.
 
What do I want today? I have only to ask for it. I may seek earnestly, but not as if I had to use pressure and extort an unwilling gift from the Lord's hand; for He will give freely. Of His own He gave us His own Son. Certainly no one would have proposed such a gift to Him. No one would have ventured to ask for it. It would have been too presumptuous.
 
He freely gave His Only-begotten, and, O my soul, can you not trust your heavenly Father to give you anything, to give you everything? Thy poor prayer would have no force with Omnipotence if force were needed; but His love, like a spring, rises of itself and overflows for the supply of all your needs. – Charles Spurgeon

The Son Shed His Blood For You
==============================

*When I see the blood, I will pass over you.* - Exodus 12:13

Even when I am unable to behold it, the Lord looks at the previous blood and passes over me because of it. If I am not so much at ease as I ought to be, because my faith is dim, yet I am equally safe because the Lord's eye is not dim, and He sees the blood of the great Sacrifice with steady gaze. What a joy is this!
 
The Lord sees the deep inner meaning, the infinite fullness of all that is meant by the death of His dear Son. He sees it with restful memory of justice satisfied, and all His matchless attributes glorified.
 
He beheld creation in its progress and said, "It is very good"; but what does He say of redemption in its completeness? What does He say of the obedience even unto death of His well-beloved Son? None can tell of His delight in Jesus, His rest in the sweet savor which Jesus presented when He offered Himself without spot unto God.
 
Now rest we in calm security. We have God's sacrifice and God's Word to create in us a sense of perfect security. He will, He must, pass over us, because He spared not our glorious Substitute. Justice joins hands with love to provide everlasting salvation for all those who are blood-sprinkled. – Charles Spurgeon

The Messiah Was Cut Off For You
===============================

*The Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself.* - Daniel 9:26

Rivers of tears, mountains of offerings, seas of bullocks' blood, and hills of frankincense, could not have availed for the removal of sin; but Jesus was cut off for us, and ... sin was put away forever. Herein is wisdom, whereby substitution, the sure and speedy way of atonement, was devised! Herein is condescension, which brought Messiah, the Prince, to wear a crown of thorns, and die upon the Cross! Herein is love, which led the Redeemer to lay down His life for His enemies!
 
It is not enough, however, to admire the spectacle of the innocent bleeding for the guilty, we must make sure of our interest therein ... Have we a part and a lot among those for whom He gave His life a ransom? Did the Lord Jesus stand as our representative? Are we healed by His stripes?
 
Solemn as the question is ... it is one that may be answered clearly and without mistake. To all who believe on Him, the Lord Jesus is a present Saviour, and upon them all the blood of reconciliation has been sprinkled. Let all who trust in the merit of Messiah's death be joyful at every remembrance of Him, and let their holy gratitude lead them to the fullest consecration to His cause. – Charles Spurgeon

You Are Perfectly Saved
=======================

*God ... has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began.* - 2 Timothy 1:9, NKJV

The apostle uses the perfect tense, meaning that this has already happened: "Who has saved us." Believers in Christ Jesus are saved. They are not looked upon as persons who are in a hopeful state, and may ultimately be saved, but they are already saved.
 
Salvation is not a blessing to be enjoyed on your deathbed, or to be enjoyed in some future life above, but something you can have now; received, promised, and enjoyed now. The Christian is perfectly saved according to God's plan. The price of salvation has already been paid: "It is finished" was the cry of the Saviour before he died. The believer is also perfectly saved in God’s covenant promise: Adam and Eve’s sin was our sin, and our life is now in Jesus Christ.
 
This complete salvation is accompanied by a holy calling. God did not choose us or call us because we were already holy, but he called us so we could be holy, and holiness is the beauty produced by God’s workmanship in us.
 
Salvation must be of grace, because the Lord is the author of it: and what motive but grace could motivate him to save the guilty? Salvation must be of grace, because Jesus covers all our guilt and unrighteousness. – Charles Spurgeon

We are Joint Heirs With Christ in His Kingdom
=============================================

*... joint heirs with Christ.* - Romans 8:17
 
The boundless realms of His Father's universe are Christ's by prescriptive right. As "heir of all things," ... He has admitted us to claim the whole as ours, by virtue of that deed of joint-heirship that the Lord has ratified with His chosen people.

The golden streets of paradise, the pearly gates, the river of life, the transcendent bliss, and the unutterable glory, are, by our blessed Lord, made over to us for our everlasting possession. All that He has He shares with His people.

He uncrowned Himself that we might have a coronation of glory; He would not sit upon His own throne until He had procured a place upon it for all who overcome by His blood ... Christ deems His happiness completed by His people sharing it.

    *"The glory which thou gavest me have I given them."*
    
    *"These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full."*

The smiles of His Father are all the sweeter to Him, because His people share them. The honours of His kingdom are more pleasing, because His people appear with Him in glory. He delights the more in His joy, because He calls them to enter into it. – Charles Spurgeon

Jesus Intercedes For Us
=======================

*I have prayed for you.* - Luke 22:32
 
How encouraging is the thought of the Redeemer's never-ceasing intercession for us. When we pray, he pleads for us; and when we are not praying, he is advocating our cause, and by his supplications shielding us from unseen dangers. Notice the word of comfort addressed to Peter: "Simon, Simon, Satan wants to have you so he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not."
 
We little know what we owe to our Saviour's prayers. When we reach the hilltops of heaven, and can review our lives to see how the Lord our God has led us, we will truly be able to praise him for guiding us and for undoing much of the mischief which Satan was attempting to do on earth. Then we will be able to thank him for his untiring care of us, and for his constant intercession with God on our behalf.
 
Even before Satan has begun to tempt, Jesus interrupts him and enters a plea in heaven. Mercy outruns malice….
 
O Jesus, what a comfort it is that you have pleaded our cause against our unseen enemies; countermined their mines, and unmasked their ambushes. Here is a matter for joy, gratitude, hope, and confidence. – Charles Spurgeon

God Always Hears You
====================

*My God will hear me.* - Micah 7:7

Friends may be unfaithful, but the Lord will not turn away from anyone who comes to him; on the contrary, He will listen to all your sincere desires. The prophet says, "Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. A man's enemies are the men of his own house." This is a wretched state of affairs; but even when other people hurt us, Jesus, our Best Friend remains true, and we may tell Him all our grief.
 
Our wisdom is to look unto the Lord and not to quarrel with other people. If our loving appeals are disregarded by our relatives, let us wait upon the God of our salvation, for He will hear us. He will hear us all the more because of the unkindness and oppression of others, and we shall soon have reason to cry, "Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy!"
 
Because God is the living God, He can hear; because He is a loving God, He will hear; because He is our covenant God, He has bound Himself to hear us. We can confidently call him "My God," and we can be absolutely certain that, "My God will hear me." So, when you are suffering, tell God about your sorrows! You can confidently say, "My God will hear me." – Charles Spurgeon

God Hears Your Faintest Call
============================

*And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered.* - Joel 2:32, KJV

Why do I not call on His name? Why do I run to my neighbour, when God is so near and will hear my faintest call? Why do I sit down and devise schemes and invent plans instead of taking myself and my burden to the Lord? Wouldn’t it be better to go straight to the living God? I will not find deliverance anywhere else; but with God I shall find it; for he is certain to help me.

I need not ask whether I may call on Him or not, for that word “whosoever” is a very wide and comprehensive one. ‘Whosoever’ means me, for it means anybody and everybody who calls upon God. I will therefore follow the leading of the text and at once call upon the glorious Lord who had made so large a promise.

My case is urgent, and I do not see how I am to be delivered; but this is no problem. God, who makes this promise, will find out ways and means of keeping it. I must simply obey His commands; I cannot tell God what to do. 

I am His servant, not His lawyer. I call upon Him, and He will deliver me. – Charles Spurgeon

God is in Control
=================

*The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord.* - Proverbs 16:33, NKJV

This text refers to how the people of old would cast lots (like throwing dice) to determine what to do. If the simple casting of a lot is guided by the Lord, how much more the events of our entire life?

Our blessed Saviour tells us:

    *“Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father’s will. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.”*
    
If you always remembered this, you would be free from anxiety, and you would be able to walk in patience, quiet, and cheerfulness.
 
If you would “seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,” all things would then be given to you. When you fret and stress about your own circumstances, you are meddling with Christ’s business. You are trying to do the work of “providing” and you forget that your work is just to obey. Be wise and focus on the obeying, and let Christ manage the providing.
 
Look at your heavenly Father’s heart of mercy; how could he ever be unkind! Look at his infinite wisdom; how could it ever fail? Your heavenly Father, who remembers even the sparrows, will never forget the least of his poor children. – Charles H. Spurgeon

God is Your Father
==================

*You are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.* - Galatians 3:26, KJV

It is the privilege of all God’s children to call him Father. Perhaps you think you have little faith. Perhaps you want to be full of courage to face the challenges of life, but you stumble at every step, and even shadows make you afraid.

You should think about this: the weakest Christian is as much a child of God as the strongest one. God, our heavenly Father, has the same tender heart towards all. One may do more mighty works, but the person whose name is the least in the kingdom of heaven is as much the child of God as the one who stands among the mightiest in the Kingdom of God. Let this truth encourage and comfort us, when we come to God and say, “Our Father.”’

However, let us not be content with weak faith, but ask, like the Apostles, to have it increased. However weak our faith may be, if it is real faith in Christ, we will reach heaven at last. However, a stronger faith will bring more honour to our Master, and we will be filled with greater joy and peace.

If it is your desire to live for Christ’s glory, then seek to be filled with the spirit of adoption more and more completely. The Spirit of God will cast out fear. –  Charles H. Spurgeon

God Will Lead You on the Right Path
===================================

*He led them forth by the right path.* - Psalm 107:7, NKJV

The ups and downs of our lives mean that believers sometimes ask, “Why do these things keep happening to me?”

The ups and downs of your faith, the fainting of your hope, all these things are really just God’s method of making you ready for the great inheritance which you will soon receive. The purpose of these trials is for the testing and strengthening of your faith. They are waves that wash you further upon the rock; they are winds that send your ship  more swiftly towards your desired haven (Psalm 107:30).

The health of your soul is maintained through honour and dishonour, by the evil things that are said of you and by the good, by plenty and by poverty, by joy and by distress, by persecution and by peace.

Don’t think, believer, that your troubles are outside of God’s plan. They are necessary parts of it. “We must, through much tribulation, enter the kingdom.” We must learn to understand our troubles in the right way, and to “count it all joy when you fall into various trials.”

Let your trembling soul be still. Even though we may not always see God’s purpose, believe that all will be well, because all is ruled by him. – Charles H. Spurgeon

Wait for the Gates of Heaven to Open
====================================

*All the days of my appointed time will I wait.* - Job 14:14, KJV

A little stay on earth will make heaven more heavenly. Nothing makes rest so sweet as work; nothing makes safety so pleasant as exposure to danger. Jesus was baptised with a baptism of suffering among humanity, and we must be baptised with the same if we would share his kingdom. The honour of fellowship with Christ is so great, that the greatest sorrow is a light thing to go through in order to have it.

Another reason why we wait here on earth is for the good of others. Our work is not yet done. We are called to give light to souls who wander in darkness in the wilderness of sin. Our wait here is also for God’s glory. A saint who has been tried, like a well-cut diamond, glitters brightly in the King’s crown. We are God’s workmanship, in whom he will be glorified by our afflictions.

It is for the honour of Jesus that we endure the trial of our faith with sacred joy. Let each person surrender his own desires to the glory of Jesus. Our time here on earth is fixed and decided by God. Let us not be anxious about it, but wait with patience till the gates of pearl shall open. – Charles H. Spurgeon

God is For Us
=============

*When I cry out to You, Then my enemies will turn back; this I know; for God is for me.* - Psalm 56:9, NKJV

It is impossible for any human speech to express the full meaning of this wonderful phrase, “God is for me.” He was “for us” before the worlds were made. He was “for us” when we were ruined in the fall—he loved us despite it all; he was “for us,” when we were rebels against him. He was “for us,” or he would not have given his beloved Son.

He has been “for us” in our many struggles, whether dangers or temptations. Where would we be today if he had not been “for us”? He is “for us,” with all the infinity of his being; with all the omnipotence of his love; with all the infallibility of his wisdom.

Because he is “for us,” when we pray, he will always help. This is not some vague hope, but a well-grounded assurance— the Psalmist says “this I know.”

He is “for us,” — eternally and irrevocably “for us”. If you have such a God, then how happy you are with the King of Kings on your side! How safe with such a Protector! How overwhelmingly will your cause be pled by such an Advocate! If God be for you, who can be against you? – Charles Spurgeon

Where Your Great Strength Lies
==============================

*Tell me where your great strength lies.* - Judges 16:6, NKJV

Where lies the secret strength of faith? It lies in what it feeds on; for faith focuses on the source of the promises of God – an overflowing of divine grace from the great heart of God.

Faith doesn’t consider the size of the promise, for all of God’s promises are great. Instead, faith asks, “Who is its author?” Faith remembers that it is God, who cannot lie. As a result, faith is able to move forward with conviction.

Faith remembers why God’s promises are given, for God’s glory, and because of his love and grace. Faith looks at the amazing work of Christ as clear proof of the Father’s intention to fulfil his word:

    *He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?* Romans 8:32
 
Faith also looks back on the past, and her past victories give her courage. She remembers that God never has failed her, and that he has never failed any of his children. (See 1 Samuel 7:12, NKJV). Because of this faith can say with confidence,

    *Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life* Psalm 23:6
 
– Charles Spurgeon

How Shall We Live?
******************

Gaining By Giving
=================

*A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.* – Prov 11:25
 
If I desire to flourish in soul, I must not hoard up my stores but must distribute to the poor. To be close and niggardly is the world's way to prosperity, but it is not God's way, for He saith, "There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, and it tendeth to poverty."
 
Faith's way of gaining is giving. I must try this again and again, and I may expect that as much of prosperity as will be good for me will come to me as a gracious reward for a liberal course of action.
 
Of course, I may not be sure of growing rich. I shall be fat but not too fat… No, if I am fat enough to be healthy, I may well be satisfied; and if the Lord grants me a competence, I may be thoroughly content.
 
But there is a mental and spiritual fatness which I would greatly covet, and this comes as the result of generous thoughts toward my God, His church, and my fellow men. Let me not stint, lest I starve my heart. Let me be bountiful and liberal, for so shall I be like my Lord. He gave Himself for me; shall I grudge Him anything? – Charles Spurgeon

Pray That Christ’s Kingdom May Be Extended
==========================================

*He shall see His seed; He shall prolong His days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand.* - Isaiah 53:10

    *Plead for the speedy fulfillment of this promise, all you who love the Lord ... How can He that gave the word refuse to keep it? Immutable veracity cannot demean itself by a lie, and eternal faithfulness cannot degrade itself by neglect ...*
 
That which the Spirit prompts us to ask for Jesus, is that which God decrees to give Him. Whenever you are praying for the kingdom of Christ, let your eyes behold the dawning of the blessed day which draweth near, when the Crucified shall receive His coronation… Your eyes cannot see the blissful future: borrow the telescope of faith; wipe the misty breath of your doubts from the glass; look through it and behold the coming glory.
 
Remember that the same Christ who tells us to say, "Give us this day our daily bread," had first given us this petition, "…Thy kingdom come…” Let not your prayers be all concerning your own sins, your own wants, your own imperfections, your own trials, but let them climb the starry ladder, and get up to Christ Himself, and then, as you draw nigh to the blood-sprinkled mercy-seat, offer this prayer continually, "Lord, extend the kingdom of Thy dear Son." Such a petition, fervently presented, will elevate the spirit of all your devotions. – Charles Spurgeon

God Loves To Hear You Claim His Promises
========================================

*Do as thou hast said.* - 2 Samuel 7:25, KJV

God’s promises were never meant to be thrown away like waste paper; he intended that they should be used. God's gold is not miser's money; it should not be hoarded, but used. Nothing pleases our Lord better than to see his promises put in circulation; he loves to see his children bring them up to him, and say, "Lord, please do as you promised."
 
Do you think that God will be any the poorer for giving you the riches he has promised? Do you think that he will be less holy because he offers his holiness to you? Do you imagine he will be any the less pure for washing aways your sins? Our Lord replies, "Your request is granted." Our heavenly Banker delights to cash his own notes.
 
Never think that God will be offended if you remind him of his promises. He loves to hear needy souls cry out to him. It is his delight to bestow favours. He is more ready to hear than you are to ask. The sun never gets tired of shining, and the fountain happily continues to flow. It is God's nature to keep his promises; so you can go confidently to him in prayer, asking "Do as you have promised." – Charles Spurgeon

We Look At Things That Are Not Seen
===================================

*We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.* - 2 Corinthians 4:18 KJV

In our Christian pilgrimage it is good, for the most part, to be looking forward. Forward lies the crown, and onward is the goal. Whether it be for hope, for joy, for consolation, or for the inspiring of our love, the future must, after all, be the grand object of the eye of faith.
 
Looking into the future we see sin cast out, the body of sin and death destroyed, the soul made perfect, and fit to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light. Looking further yet, the believer's enlightened eye can see beyond death to a light-filled eternity; he sees himself enter the heavenly gates, hailed as “more than conqueror,” crowned by the hand of Christ, embraced in the arms of Jesus, glorified with him, and permitted “to sit together with him on his throne, even as he has overcome and has sat down with the Father on his throne.”
 
The joys of heaven will surely compensate for the sorrows of earth. So let us not doubt! Death is just a narrow stream. Time, how short—eternity, how long! Death, how brief—immortality, how endless! – Charles Spurgeon

Faith Leads to Obedience
========================

*Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.* - Romans 3:31, KJV

When the believer is adopted into the Lord's family, his relationship to old Adam and the law ceases at once; then he is under a new rule, and a new covenant. Believer, you are God's child; it is your first duty to obey your heavenly Father.

Does he instruct his people to love one another? Do it, not because the law says, "Love your neighbour," but because Jesus says, "If you love me, keep my commandments;" and this is the commandment that he has given unto you, "that you love one another."

Are you told to give to the poor? Do it, not because charity is a burden that you dare not shirk, but because Jesus teaches, "Give to those who are needy."

Does the Bible say, "Love God with all your heart"? Look at the commandment and reply, "Ah! That’s a commandment! Jesus fulfilled all the commandments on the Cross. I have no need, therefore, to fulfill this or any other commandment in order to be saved, but I rejoice to love God because he is my Father and Redeemer now and I belong to him."

May the Holy Ghost make your heart obedient to the constraining power of Christ's love. Grace is the mother and nurse of holiness, and not the defender of sin. – Charles Spurgeon

Care For The Poor
=================

*Remember the poor.* - Galatians 2:10, KJV

Why does God allow so many of his children to be poor? He could make them all rich if he pleased. There is no necessity that they should be poor, except that he allows it. He could supply them, but he does not choose to do so; he allows them to suffer want, he allows them to remain poor and unnoticed. Why is this?

We can never understand God’s reasons fully. However, I believe that one reason is to give us, who are favoured with enough, an opportunity of demonstrating our love for Jesus. If there were no needy people in the world, we would not have the privilege of demonstrating our Christian love, by ministering with our gifts.

It may be that God has given us this opportunity to prove that our love for him is more than words, and that it extends to our fellow men as well — a love not in word only, but in deed and in truth.

If we truly love Christ, those who are dear to him will be dear to us also. That extends to “the world”, for we are reminded that “God so loved the world ...”.

So let us consider it a privilege, not a duty, to help the poor of the Lord’s flock — remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, “Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me.” All we do for his people is graciously accepted by Christ as done to himself. – Charles Spurgeon

Communion And Service
=====================

*Martha was distracted with all her preparations...* - Luke 10:40, NASB

Martha’s fault was not that she was preparing and serving the meal: it is a good thing for every Christian to serve others. In fact, “I serve” should be the motto of all the princes of the royal family of heaven. And it was not Martha’s fault that she had “much serving” (KJV). We cannot do too much. Let us do all that we possibly can  in the Master’s service. It was a great privilege to be busy preparing a feast for the Master. How fortunate she was to have an opportunity of entertaining so blessed a guest; and fortunate, too, to have the spirit to throw her whole soul so heartily into the task.

Martha’s fault was that she grew “distracted with all her preparations”, so that she forgot the Master, and only remembered the preparations. She allowed her service to override communion, so her service did not have the blessing of her communion with Jesus.

The lesson of this story is that we should be Martha and Mary in one: we should do much service, and have much communion at the same time. For this we need great grace. It is easier to be busy and to serve than to commune.

If we are to be truly useful in God’s service in this life, we must keep ourselves in constant communion with the Lord Jesus; we must ensure that the vital spirituality of our religion is maintained over and above everything else in the world. – Charles Spurgeon

The Eternal God is Your Helper
==============================

*I will help you, says the Lord.* - Isaiah 41:14, NKJV

This morning let us hear the Lord Jesus speak to each one of us: “I will help you,” he says.

Here are some of the other things he would say to us if we listen to him through his word:

    *“It is easy for Me, your God, to help you. Consider what I have done already. Why, I bought you with My blood. I have died for you; and if I have done these great things, why wouldn’t I do smaller things for you? I can do so much for you, and I will do even more."*

    *"Before the world began, I chose you. I made the covenant for you. I laid aside My glory and became a man for you; I gave up My life for you; and if I did all this, I will surely help you now… Do you need more strength than the omnipotence of God? Do you want more wisdom than exists in God the Father, more love than his Son has showed to us, or more power than the Holy Spirit has to work in your life?"*

Bring everything to God — your sadness and loneliness, your troubles, your needs. See how full God’s river of blessing is for you, so full that you don’t need anything else. You can be strong in God, because he is your helper! – Charles Spurgeon

How to Enjoy Peace With God
===========================

*Father, I have sinned.* – Luke 15:18 KJV

Those whom Christ has washed in his precious blood no longer stand where they can be condemned, but are once for all “accepted in the Beloved”. They are God’s precious children. But even children offend, so it is good for them to be in the habit of going every day to their heavenly Father to confess their sin, and acknowledge the sinfulness in their character.

If you do not develop this daily habit: what will be the consequences? You will feel at a distance from him; you will begin to doubt his love for you; you will grow like the prodigal son, who, although still his father’s child, was so far away from his father.

But if you acknowledge your mistakes, and are sorry for offending so gracious and loving a Parent; if you go to him and tell him all, and accept his forgiveness, then you will feel restored to a close, loving relationship with God. You will go through your Christian life knowing you are saved, and also enjoying present peace in God through Jesus Christ your Lord.

We have been cleansed once for all, but our feet still need to be washed from the defilement of our daily walk as children of God.  – Charles Spurgeon

How to Be Saved
===============

*If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.* - Romans 10:9, NKJV

There must be confession with the mouth. Have you made it? Have you openly avowed your faith in Jesus as the Saviour whom God has raised from the dead, and have you done it in God's way? Let us all answer this question honestly.

There must also be belief with the heart. Do you sincerely believe in the risen Lord Jesus? Do you trust in Him as your sole hope of salvation? Is this trust from your heart? Let us all answer this question before God.

If you can truly claim that you have both confessed Christ and believed in Him, then you are saved. The text does not say it may be so, but it is plain as a pikestaff and clear as the sun in the heavens: "Thou shalt be saved." As a believer and a confessor, you may lay your hand on this promise and plead it before the Lord God at this moment, and throughout life, and in the hour of death, and at the Day of Judgement.

You must be saved from the guilt of sin, the power of sin, the punishment of sin, and ultimately from the very being of sin. God has said it—"Thou shalt be saved." If you believe it, you will be saved. You are saved. Glory be to God forever and ever! – Charles Spurgeon

The Kingdom of Heaven is for the Peacemakers
============================================

*Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.* - Matthew 5:9, NIV

This is the seventh of the beatitudes: and seven was the number of perfection among the Hebrews. Whoever desires perfect blessedness, so far as it can be enjoyed on earth, must reach this seventh blessing, and become a peacemaker. There is a significance also in the position of the text. The verse which precedes it speaks of the blessedness of “the pure in heart” (v.8).  Our peacefulness is never to be a toleration of evil.

The verse that follows also seems to have been put there on purpose.

    *“Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness.”* v.10

However peaceable we may be in this world, we will still be misrepresented and misunderstood. Even the Prince of Peace himself was “despised and rejected of men.” In this way, the peacemakers are not blessed, but they are surrounded, before and after, with blessings.

Let us pray for grace to climb to this seventh beatitude! Let us ask the Lord to purify our minds so we may be “first pure, then peaceable” (James 3:17), and to fortify our souls, that our peaceableness may not lead us into cowardice and despair, when we are persecuted for Christ’s sake. – Charles Spurgeon

Your Life Proves God to Others
==============================

*The only letter I need is you yourselves! By looking at the good change in your hearts, everyone can see that we have done a good work among you.* - 2 Corinthians 3:2, TLB

God wants all His children to be living examples of aspects of His character. I don’t think any one of the children of God proves all of God, but we all prove different parts of His one grand character.

The thief on the cross proved the patience of God. Mary Magdalene proved his pardoning grace. Job proved that God is able to sustain us amidst unparalleled sufferings.

However, we should not think that the testimony of the witnesses is closed. Each of God’s saints is sent into the world to prove some part of the Divine Character. Each Christian displays some attribute or other of God. When the whole is combined, like the sun that shines in all its splendour, we will see in Christian experience a beautiful revelation of our God!

In fact, we are able to prove all of God’s promises in our lifetimes. On the last great day, we will find that every one of them has been fulfilled! This is not just true for us individually, because all of God’s promises will also be fulfilled in the united experience of the Church. – Charles Spurgeon

To Live is Christ
=================

*For me to live is Christ.* - Philippians 1:21, NKJV

Paul’s words mean more than most men think; they imply that the aim and purpose of his life was Christ; even his life itself was Jesus. He ate, and drank, and slept eternal life. Jesus was his very breath, the soul of his soul, the heart of his heart, the life of his life.
 
Can you say, as a professing Christian, that you live up to this ideal? Can you honestly say that for you to live is Christ? Your business—are you doing it for Christ? Or are you doing it your own personal benefit and for the benefit of your family? Are you surprised if I say that these reasons are too shabby for doing your business? For a Christian they are. A Christian professes to live for Christ; how can he live for another purpose without committing spiritual adultery?

Many there are who carry out this principle in some degree; but who is there who dares to say that he lives entirely for Christ as the apostle did? Yet, this alone is the true life of a Christian—its source, its sustenance, its method, its purpose and goal, is all gathered up in one word—Christ Jesus. – Charles Spurgeon

How to Love Christ More
=======================

*We love him because He first loved us.* - 1 John 4:19, NKJV

We should love Christ much more than we do at present. Christ has spontaneously shown us such love when we were his enemies, that even if our every breath and pulse was devoted to him, if we had ten thousand lives and we laid them all down for him, we would be perfectly justified in doing that, and ten thousand times more, if it were possible.

Our love to our Lord Jesus Christ is an effect produced by a great cause, namely, his eternal love to us. If you really believe that he has loved you with such love, then you must love him, must you not? Can your heart resist his charms?

The heart that does not feel moved whenever the love of Christ is proclaimed must be a hard heart indeed. Yet we must not try to make ourselves love our Lord, but look to Christ's love first, for his love will create in us love towards him.

If you are distressed because you cannot love Christ as much as you would like to, then just forget your own love to him, and focus on his great love to you. The more you do this, the more your love will transform into what you desire it to be. - Charles Spurgeon

You Will Be Satisfied by God’s Grace
====================================

*They are abundantly satisfied with the fullness of Your house, And You give them drink from the river of Your pleasures.* - Psalm 36:8, NKJV

When the Queen of Sheba visited Solomon, she was astonished when she saw the food and the generosity that was shown to welcome her. But even this cannot be compared to the generosity of the grace of God!

Millions of God’s people are fed daily by his grace. Everyone comes hungry and thirsty, but no one leaves unsatisfied. There is enough of the grace of God for you, enough for all, and enough for ever. The Lord spreads his table, not for one, but many saints, not for one day, but for many years; not for many years only, but for generation after generation.

The text tells us that the guests at mercy’s banquet are even more than just “satisfied”; they are “abundantly satisfied.” This feasting is guaranteed by God’s faithful promise to every person who puts their trust in God.

I once thought that if I could only get the left-overs at God’s back door of grace I would be satisfied; like the woman who said, “The dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.” But no child of God is ever served with scraps and left-overs. Like Mephibosheth, they all eat from the king’s own table: such is the marvellous abundance of grace which God gives us to enjoy. – Charles H. Spurgeon

To Enter the Kingdom of God
===========================

*We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.* - Acts 14:22, KJV

Trials are a part of our lot in life. If we are Christ’s heirs, then he left trials to us in his legacy. So surely as the stars are fashioned by his hands, and their orbits fixed by him, so surely are our trials given to us.

Followers of Jesus must never expect to escape troubles. If they do, they will be disappointed, for none of their predecessors have been without them. Read the biographies of all the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and you will discover that everyone to whom God showed his mercy were made to pass through the fire of affliction.

In ancient times, a royal mark was placed on all the treasures that belonged to the king. The royal mark of the Cross distinguishes with honour all those who have received God’s mercy.

Although God’s children must walk through the path of tribulation, they have the comfort of knowing that their Master has walked this path before them. They have his presence and kindness to cheer them, his grace to support them, and his example to teach them how to endure.

When you have finally reached “the kingdom,” it will more than make amends for the “much tribulation” through which you passed to enter it. – Charles H. Spurgeon

Cry Out to God
==============

*To You I will cry, O Lord my Rock: Do not be silent to me, Lest, if You are silent to me, I become like those who go down to the pit.* - Psalm 28:1

When everything fails us, we must direct our cry to the Lord, for to cry to other people is to waste our efforts. The Lord is willing to hear, and he is able to help.

Those who genuinely cry to God aren’t satisfied with the results of prayer itself in calming the mind—they must go further and obtain actual replies from heaven. They dread even a little of God’s silence. God’s voice is often so terrible that it shakes the wilderness; but his silence is equally terrible to an eager suppliant.

When God seems to close his ear, we must not therefore close our mouths. Instead, we should cry to him all the more, and depend on him more. He will not long deny us a hearing.

What a dreadful situation we would be in if the Lord should become forever silent to our prayers. Without the God who answers prayer, we would be in a more terrible position than the dead in the grave, or even those who are lost forever.

We must have answers to prayer. Surely the Lord will speak peace to our agitated minds. He can never find it in his heart to permit his beloved people to perish. – Charles Spurgeon

Your Tears Will Cease
=====================

*And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes...* - Revelation 21:4, KJV

Yes, we shall come to this if we are believers. Sorrow shall cease, and tears shall be wiped away. This is the world of weeping, but it passes away. There shall be a new heaven and a new earth, so says the first verse of this chapter; and therefore there will be nothing to weep over concerning the Fall and its consequent miseries.

Read the second verse and note how it speaks of the bride and her marriage. The Lamb's wedding is a time for boundless pleasure, and tears would be out of place. The third verse says that God Himself will dwell among men; and surely at His right hand there are pleasures forevermore, and tears can no longer flow.

What will our state be when there will be no more sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain? This will be more glorious than we can as yet imagine. O eyes that are red with weeping, cease your scalding flow, for in a little while ye shall know no more tears! None can wipe tears away like the God of love, but He is coming to do it.

"Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning." Come, Lord, and tarry not; for now both men and women must weep! – Charles Spurgeon

Pray for the Servants of God
============================

*Brethren, pray for us...* - 1 Thessalonians 5:25

I want to remind you of the importance of praying for ministers.

The work of ministers of Christ involves the salvation or condemnation of thousands. We deal with souls for God, on his eternal business (2 Corinthians 2:16, NKJV). We have a very heavy responsibility which rests upon us. It will be a great blessing if in the end we are found clear of the blood of all men.

As officers in Christ’s army, we are the special target of the hatred of men and devils. They watch for us to stumble, to attack us when we are down. We witness very sad backslidings, and our hearts are wounded; we see millions perishing, and our spirits sink.

You are right not to look to us, but to our Master for spiritual blessings; however, dear friends, intercede for us with God. We will be in misery without your prayers, but we will be blessed if we live in your supplications before God.

Ask then, again and again, that we may be the earthen vessels into which the Lord may put the treasure of the gospel. We, the whole company of missionaries, ministers, and servants of God in various capacities, do in the name of Jesus, beg you that you pray for us. – Charles Spurgeon

Pray for the Glory of God to Fill the Earth
===========================================

*Let the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen and Amen.* - Psalm 72:19, NKJV

There are times when to pray for just one person is enough to stagger us. To intercede for a whole city needs a vast amount of faith. But how far-reaching was the psalmist’s request:

    *“Let the whole earth be filled with his glory.”*

This prayer does not ignore a single country, however crushed it might be under the foot of superstition. This prayer is uttered for every culture and race. It encompasses the entire earth, leaving out not even one son or daughter of Adam.

Is this your prayer? Turn your eyes to Calvary. Look at the Lord of Life nailed to a cross. When you feel his blood applied to your guilt, and when you know that he has blotted out your sins, how can you avoid falling to your knees and crying out, “Let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.”

How can you bow before your crucified Saviour in loving homage, and not wish to see your King the master of the world? How can you pretend to love Prince Jesus and not desire to see him be the universal ruler?

Your religion is worthless unless it leads you to wish for that same mercy that God has extended to you to bless the whole world. – Charles Spurgeon

The Son Shed His Blood For You
==============================

*When I see the blood, I will pass over you.* - Exodus 12:13

Even when I am unable to see it, the Lord looks at the blood of his sacrifice and passes over me because of it. If I feel uncertain about this because my faith is not strong, yet I am safe because God sees the blood of the great Sacrifice with steady gaze. What a joy is this!
 
God sees the deep inner meaning, the infinite mercy of all that is meant by the death of His dear Son. The price of sin has been paid for all eternity, and God’s love is clear to the entire universe.
 
When God saw his creation, He said, "It is very good"; so, what does He say about redemption in its completeness? What does He say of the obedience even unto death of His well-beloved Son? We cannot even imagine His delight in Jesus, when He offered Himself without spot to God.
 
Now rest we in calm security. We have God's sacrifice and God's Word to create in us a sense of perfect security. He will, He must, pass over us, because He spared not our glorious Substitute. Justice joins hands with love to provide everlasting salvation for all those who are blood-sprinkled. – Charles Spurgeon (adapted)

His Church Makes Jesus Glad
===========================

*They have made you glad.* - Psalm 45:8, NKJV

Who are the ones who are privileged to make the Saviour glad? His church—his people. But how is it possible to Jesus glad? 

The Saviour makes us glad, but is there a way can we make him glad? Yes. By our love. Even when we sorrowfully confess our love for Christ to be so cold and faint, it is very sweet to him. Christ delights in you. When you lean your head on his breast, you not only receive, but you give him joy; when you gaze with love upon his glorious face, you not only obtain comfort but impart delight. 

Our praise, too, gives Christ joy—not the song of our lips alone, but the melody of the heart’s deep gratitude. Our gifts, too, are pleasing to him; he loves to see us lay our time, our talents, our possessions upon the altar, not for the value of what we give, but because of the motive from which the gift springs. To him, the lowly offerings of his saints are more acceptable than vast quantities of gold and silver. 

Forgive your enemy, and you make Christ glad; distribute your possessions to the poor, and he rejoices; be the means of saving souls, and you give him the results of his suffering; proclaim his gospel, and you are a sweet savour unto him; go among the those who do not know and lift up the cross, and you have given him honour. 

It is in your power right now to break the alabaster box, and pour the precious oil of joy upon his head, as did Mary. Her loving act is remembered wherever the gospel is preached. Will you not perfume your beloved Lord with the perfume of your heart’s praise? – Charles Spurgeon adapted

God Shows Mercy to His Church
O Lord of hosts, how long will You not have mercy on Jerusalem? And the Lord answered the angel who talked to me, with good and comforting words (Zechariah 1:12–13, NKJV). 

God loves the church with a love too deep for human imagination: he loves her with all his infinite heart. Because of it, be of good courage. You cannot be far from blessing when God speaks to you “with good and comforting words.”  The prophet Zechariah goes on to tell us what these comforting words are saying: 

I am zealous for Jerusalem And for Zion with great zeal (Zechariah 1:14, NKJV). 

The Lord loves his church so much that he cannot bear that she should go astray; and when she has done so, he cannot endure that she should suffer. When God seems most to leave his church, his heart is warm towards her: As a father pities his children, So the Lord pities those who fear Him (Psalm 103:13, NKJV). 

He who counts the stars, and calls them by their names, is in no danger of forgetting you. He knows your situation as thoroughly as if you were the only creature he ever made or the only saint he ever loved. Approach him and be at peace. – Charles Spurgeon adapted

The Church Carries A Cross
==========================

*On him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.* - Luke 23:26, NKJV

When Simon of Cyrene carried Christ’s cross, we see a picture of the work of the Church throughout all generations. The church is the cross-bearer after Jesus. Christ does not suffer in order so that you may be free from suffering. He bears a cross, not that you may escape it, but that you may endure it. Christ exempts you from sin, but not from sorrow. 

But let us comfort ourselves with this thought, that in our case, as in Simon's, it is not our cross, but Christ’s cross which we carry. When you are mocked for your religion, then remember it is not your cross, it is Christ's cross. Remember what a privilege it is to carry the cross of our Lord Jesus!  

When you carry the cross after the Lord Jesus, you have blessed company. Your path is marked with the footprints of your Lord. Take up your cross daily, and follow him.  

And remember, though Simon had to bear the cross for a very little while, it gave him lasting honour. In the same way, the cross we carry is only for a little while, and then we shall receive the crown and glory (2 Corinthians 4:17, NKJV). – Charles Spurgeon

Be Sanctified Through the Truth
===============================

*"Sanctify them by your truth."* - John 17:17, NKJV

Sanctification begins in regeneration. The Spirit of God infuses into man that new living principle by which he becomes “a new creature” in Christ Jesus. This work is carried on in two ways—mortification, whereby the lusts of the flesh are subdued; and vivification, by which the life which God has put within us is made to be a well of water springing up unto everlasting life. 

Through the Spirit, the Christian is preserved and continued in a gracious state, and is made to abound in good works unto the praise and glory of God. It culminates or comes to perfection, in “glory,” when the soul caught up to dwell with holy beings at the right hand of the Majesty on high. 

But while the Spirit of God is the author of sanctification, there is a visible agency in sanctification which must not be forgotten. Jesus said that we are to be sanctified by the truth of the Word of God. 

The Spirit of God brings to our minds the truths of God’s Word and applies them with power. The truth is the sanctifier, and if we do not hear or read the truth, we will not grow in sanctification. We only progress in sound living as we progress in sound understanding (Psalm 119:105, NKJV). – Charles Spurgeon

The Lord is Your Everlasting Strength
=====================================

*Trust ye in the Lord forever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.* - Isaiah 26:4, KJV

Because we have a God in whom we can trust, let us rest upon him with all our weight. Let us drive out all unbelief, and endeavour to get rid of doubts and fears, which so much disturb our comfort. There is no excuse for fear where God is the foundation of our trust. 

A loving parent would be saddened if his child could not trust him. How ungenerous, how unkind is our conduct when we put so little confidence in our heavenly Father who has never failed us, and who never will. Doubting should be banished from the household of God. 

When we speak of God, it should be with the greatest confidence. There is none like him in the heaven above or the earth beneath: 

    *"To whom then will you liken Me, Or to whom shall I be equal?" says the Holy One.* Isaiah 40:25, NKJV). 

We have been in many trials, but we have never yet been in a situation in which we could not find in our God all that we needed. Let us then be encouraged to trust in the Lord forever, assured that his everlasting strength will be, as it has been, our help and support. – Charles Spurgeon adapted

You Are Called to Be Saints
===========================

*Beloved of God, called to be saints.* - Romans 1:7, NKJV

We often tend to consider the New Testament saints as if they were “saints” in a more special way than the other children of God. The fact is, if we had seen the apostle Paul, we should have thought him remarkably like the rest of us. 

All are “saints” whom God has called by His grace, and sanctified by His Spirit. Don’t look upon the ancient saints as being exempt either from weaknesses or sins; and don’t consider them with that mystic reverence which can almost make us idolaters. Their holiness is attainable even by us. We are “called to be saints” by that same voice which called them to their high calling. 

It is every Christian’s duty to enter into the inner circle of saintship. If these saints were superior to us in their achievements, as they certainly were, let us follow them. Let us imitate their zeal and holiness. 

We have the same light that they had, and the same grace is accessible to us. Why should we rest satisfied until we have equalled them in heavenly character? They lived with Jesus, they lived for Jesus, therefore they grew like Jesus. Let us live by the same Spirit as they did, “looking unto Jesus,” and Jesus will acknowledge our saintship. – Charles Spurgeon, adapted

Never Be Cast Out
================= 

*"Whoever comes to me I will never cast out."* – John 6:37, ESV
 
Is there any instance of our Lord's casting out one who came to him? If there be so, we would like to know of it; but there has been none, and there never will be. Among the lost souls in hell there is not one that can say, "I went to Jesus, and He refused me." It is not possible that you or I should be the first to whom Jesus shall break His word. Let us not entertain so dark a suspicion.
 
Suppose we go to Jesus now about the evils of today. Of this we can be sure, that He will not refuse to hear us or cast us out. Those of us who have often gone to Him and those who have never gone before—let us go together, and we shall see that He will not shut the door of His grace in the face of any one of us.
 
"This man receiveth sinners," but He repulses none. We come to Him in weakness and sin, with trembling faith, and little knowledge, and slender hope; but He does not cast us out. We come by prayer, and that prayer broken; with confession, and that confession faulty; with praise, and that praise far short of His merits; but yet He receives us. We come diseased, polluted, worn out, and worthless; but He does not in any way cast us out. Let us come again today to Him who never casts us out. – Charles Spurgeon

Pray That Christ’s Kingdom May Be Extended
==========================================

*He shall see His seed; He shall prolong His days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand.* - Isaiah 53:10 NKJV

Plead for the speedy fulfilment of this promise, all you who love the Lord. How can he that gave the word refuse to keep it? Immutable veracity cannot demean itself by a lie, and eternal faithfulness cannot degrade itself by neglect.
 
That which the Spirit prompts us to ask for Jesus, is that which God decrees to give him. Whenever you are praying for the kingdom of Christ, let your eyes behold the dawning of the blessed day which draws near, when the Crucified shall receive his coronation. Your eyes cannot see the blissful future: borrow the telescope of faith; wipe the misty breath of your doubts from the glass; look through it and behold the coming glory.
 
Remember that the same Christ who tells us to say, "Give us this day our daily bread," had first given us this petition, "...Thy kingdom come..." Let not your prayers be all concerning your own sins, your own wants, your own imperfections, your own trials, but let them climb the starry ladder, and get up to Christ himself, and then, as you draw near to the blood-sprinkled mercy-seat, offer this prayer continually, "Lord, extend the kingdom of Thy dear Son." Such a petition, fervently presented, will elevate the spirit of all your devotions. – Charles Spurgeon

Enlist Jesus’ Help  
==================

*But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!* - Matthew 14:30, NIV

Sinking times are praying times with the Lord’s servants. Peter neglected prayer at starting upon his venturous journey, but when he began to sink his danger made him a suppliant, and his cry though late was not too late. In our hours of bodily pain and mental anguish, we find ourselves as naturally driven to prayer as the wreck is driven upon the shore by the waves.

Heaven’s great harbour of refuge is All-prayer; thousands of weather-beaten vessels have found a haven there, and the moment a storm comes on, it is wise for us to make for it with all sail. Short prayers are long enough. There were but three words in the petition which Peter gasped out, but they were sufficient for his purpose. Not length but strength is desirable. A sense of need is a mighty teacher of brevity.

Precious things lie in small compass, and all that is real prayer in many a long address might have been uttered in a petition as short as that of Peter. Immediately a keen sense of danger forces an anxious cry from us the ear of Jesus hears, and with him ear and heart go together, and the hand does not long linger.

Let us then lift up our souls unto our Saviour, and we may rest assured that he will not suffer us to perish. When we can do nothing, Jesus can do all things; let us enlist his powerful aid upon our side, and all will be well. – Charles Spurgeon

The Sacred Importance and Necessity of Prayer  
=============================================

*Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.* - Colossians 4:2, NIV

It is interesting to remark how large a portion of Sacred Writ is occupied with the subject of prayer, either in furnishing examples, enforcing precepts, or pronouncing promises. We scarcely open the Bible before we read, “Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord;” and just as we are about to close the volume, the “Amen” of an earnest supplication meets our ear. Instances are plentiful.

Here we find a wrestling Jacob—there a Daniel who prayed three times a day—and a David who with all his heart called upon his God. On the mountain we see Elias; in the dungeon Paul and Silas. We have multitudes of commands and myriads of promises.

We may be certain that whatever God has made prominent in his Word, he intended to be conspicuous in our lives. If he has said much about prayer, it is because he knows we have much need of it. So deep are our necessities, that until we are in heaven we must not cease to pray. Do you want nothing? Then, I fear you do not know your poverty. Have you no mercy to ask of God? Then, may the Lord’s mercy show you your misery! A prayerless soul is a Christless soul.

Prayer is the breath, the watchword, the comfort, the strength, the honour of a Christian. If you are a child of God, you will seek your Father’s face and live in your Father’s love. Pray that you may be holy, humble, zealous, and patient; have closer communion with Christ, and enter oftener into the banqueting-house of his love. Your motto should be “Continue in prayer.” – Charles Spurgeon

Prayer – The Safest Method
==========================

*In return for my love they accuse me, but I give myself to prayer.* - Psalm 109:4, ESV

Prayer is the safest method of replying to words of hatred. The Psalmist prayed in no cold-hearted manner, he gave himself to the exercise—threw his whole soul and heart into it—straining every sinew and muscle, as Jacob did when wrestling with the angel. Thus, shall any of us speed at the throne of grace.

Our thoughts go roving hither and thither, and we make little progress towards our desired end. Like quicksilver, our mind will not hold together but rolls off this way and that. How great an evil this is! It injures us, and what is worse, it insults our God.

What should we think of a petitioner, if, while having an audience with a prince, he should be playing with a feather or catching a fly? David did not cry once, and then relapse into silence; his holy clamour was continued till it brought down the blessing. Prayer must not be our chance work, but our daily business, our habit, and vocation. – Charles Spurgeon

The Lord Our Righteousness  
==========================

*In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which he will be called; The Lord Our Righteous Saviour.* - Jeremiah 23:6, NIV

It will always give a Christian the greatest calm, quiet, ease, and peace, to think of the perfect righteousness of Christ. How often are the saints of God downcast and sad!

I do not think they ought to be. I do not think they would be if they could always see their perfection in Christ. There are some who are always talking about corruption, and the depravity of the heart, and the innate evil of the soul. This is quite true, but why not go a little further, and remember that we are "perfect in Christ Jesus."

If we call to mind that "Christ is made unto us righteousness", we will be of good cheer. There is nothing wanting in my Lord, Christ has done it all. On the Cross he said, "It is finished!" and if it is finished, then I am complete in him, and can rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, not having my own righteousness but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.

When the believer says, "I live on Christ alone; I rest on him solely for salvation; and I believe that, however unworthy I am still saved in Jesus;" then there rises up as a motive of gratitude this thought -- "Will I not live to Christ? Will I not love him and serve him, seeing that I am saved by his merits?"

If saved by imputed righteousness, we shall greatly value imparted righteousness. – Charles Spurgeon

Deliver Us from Evil  
====================

*"Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation."* - Luke 11:4, NIV

We should avoid temptation so that we may never tempt the devil to tempt us. We are not to enter the thicket in search of the lion. This lion may cross our path or leap upon us from the thicket, but we should have nothing to do with hunting him.

Let the Christian pray that he may be spared his encounter. Our Saviour earnestly admonished his disciples— "Pray that you may not enter into temptation." We will be tempted; so, we also pray "deliver us from evil."

God had one Son without sin, but he has no son without temptation. The natural man is born to trouble and the Christian is born to temptation just as certainly. We must be always on our watch against Satan, because, like a thief, he gives no intimation of his approach.

Believers who have had experience of the ways of Satan, know that there are certain seasons when he will most probably make an attack. The Christian is put on a double guard by fear of danger, and the danger is averted by preparing to meet it. Prevention is better than cure: it is better to be so well-armed that the devil will not attack you than to endure the perils of the fight, even though you come off a conqueror.

Pray this evening first that you may not be tempted. If temptation is permitted, pray that you will be delivered from the evil one. – Charles Spurgeon

The Secret of Contentment
=========================

*I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.* - Philippians 4:11, NIV

Contentment is not our natural propensity. Covetousness, discontent, and murmuring are as natural to us as thorns are to the soil. We do not need to sow thistles and brambles and we do not need to teach men to complain.

If we want to have wheat, we must plough and sow; if we want flowers, there must be the garden, and all the gardener’s care. Contentment is one of the flowers of heaven. If we are to have it, it must be cultivated; it will not grow in us by nature.

It is the new nature alone that can produce it. Even then we must be especially careful and watchful to maintain and cultivate the grace which God has sown in us. Paul says, "I have learned ... to be content;" which means he did not know how to be content at one time.

It cost him some pains to attain the mystery of that great truth. No doubt he sometimes thought he had learned, and then broke down.

Do not indulge the notion that you can be contented with learning or learn without discipline. It is not a power that can be exercised naturally, but a science to be acquired gradually. We know this from experience. Let us hush that murmur that comes naturally and continue to be a diligent student in the College of Content. – Charles Spurgeon

Christ’s Work in Me

Salvation is of the Lord (Jonah 2:9, NIV).

Salvation is the work of God. It is he alone who quickens the soul “dead in trespasses and sins,” and it is he also who maintains the soul in its spiritual life. He is both “Alpha and Omega.”

When I am prayerful, it is God who has made me prayerful; when I am blessed, it is God’s gift to me; when I do good deeds, it is because God is holding my hand. God cares for me and sustains me.

Any goodness in me comes from the Lord alone. My sin is my own; but when I act rightly, that is of God, wholly and completely. If I have beaten back a spiritual enemy, the Lord gave me the strength to do it. If I show an example of a Christian life, it is because of Christ, who lives in me.

God’s Holy Spirit sanctifies me, and helps me learn more about Jesus Christ.

God provides all my needs, both physical and spiritual. “He only is my rock and my salvation” (Psalm 62:2).

Jesus continually gives me strength to live the Christian life, because without him I would be too weak to follow him. Without Jesus I can do nothing. Jonah learned the lesson which we need to remember every day: “Salvation is of the Lord.”

– Charles Spurgeon

God Loves To Hear You Claim Your Promises
=========================================
 
*Do as thou hast said.* - 2 Samuel 7:25, KJV

God’s promises were never meant to be thrown away like waste paper; he intended that they should be used. God’s gold is not miser’s money; it should not be hoarded, but used. Nothing pleases our Lord better than to see his promises put in circulation; he loves to see his children bring them up to him, and say, “Lord, please do as you promised.”

Do you think that God will be any the poorer for giving you the riches he has promised? Do you think that he will be less holy because he offers his holiness to you? Do you imagine he will be any the less pure for washing away your sins?… Our Lord replies, “Your request is granted.”… Our heavenly Banker delights to cash his own notes.

Never think that God will be offended if you remind him of his promises. He loves to hear needy souls cry out to him. It is his delight to bestow favours. He is more ready to hear than you are to ask. The sun never gets tired of shining, and the fountain happily continues to flow. It is God’s nature to keep his promises; so you can go confidently to him in prayer, asking “Do as you have promised.” – Charles Spurgeon

We Look At Things That Are Not Seen
===================================

*We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.* - 2 Corinthians 4:18 KJV

In our Christian pilgrimage it is good, for the most part, to be looking forward. Forward lies the crown, and onward is the goal. Whether it be for hope, for joy, for consolation, or for the inspiring of our love, the future must, after all, be the grand object of the eye of faith.

Looking into the future we see sin cast out, the body of sin and death destroyed, the soul made perfect, and fit to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light. Looking further yet, the believer’s enlightened eye can see beyond death to a light-filled eternity; he sees himself enter the heavenly gates, hailed as “more than conqueror,” crowned by the hand of Christ, embraced in the arms of Jesus, glorified with him, and permitted “to sit together with him on his throne, even as he has overcome and has sat down with the Father on his throne.”

The joys of heaven will surely compensate for the sorrows of earth. So let us not doubt! Death is just a narrow stream. Time, how short—eternity, how long! Death, how brief—immortality, how endless! – Charles Spurgeon

We Must Not Cease To Pray
=========================

*Continue in prayer.* - Col 4:2, NKJV

It is interesting to notice how large a portion of the Bible is occupied with the subject of prayer. We scarcely open the Bible before we read, “Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord,” and just as we are about to close the volume, the “Amen” of an earnest request meets our ear.

Here we find a wrestling Jacob; there a Daniel who prayed three times a day; and a David who with all his heart called upon his God. On the mountain we see Elijah; in the dungeon, Paul and Silas. All these stories teach us about the sacred importance and necessity of prayer.

We may be certain that whatever God has made prominent in his Word, he intended to be conspicuous in our lives. If he has said much about prayer, it is because he knows we have much need of it. So deep are our necessities, that until we are in heaven we must not cease to pray.

A prayerless soul is a Christless soul. Prayer is the lisping of the believing infant, the shout of the fighting believer, the final thoughts of the dying saint falling asleep in Jesus. It is the breath, the watchword, the comfort, the strength, the honour of a Christian. – Charles Spurgeon

You Are Perfect in Christ  
Apr 15, 2020 05:00 am  
 

Him we preach… that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus (Col 1:28, NKJV).

Do you not feel in your own soul that perfection is not in you? Does not every day teach you that? Every tear which trickles from your eye, weeps “imperfection”; every harsh word which proceeds from your lip, mutters “imperfection”…

But amidst this sad consciousness of imperfection, here is comfort for you—you are “perfect in Christ Jesus.” In God’s sight, you are “complete in Him;” even now you are “accepted in the Beloved.”

But there is a second perfection, yet to be realized, which is sure… Is it not delightful to look forward to the time when every stain of sin shall be removed from the believer, and he shall be presented faultless before the throne, without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing? The Church of Christ then will be so pure, that not even the eye of Omniscience will see a spot or blemish in her.

Then shall we know, and taste, and feel the happiness of this vast but short sentence, “Complete in Christ.” Not till then shall we fully comprehend the heights and depths of the salvation of Jesus.

Does not your heart leap for joy at the thought of it? …Christ takes a worm and transforms it into an angel, matchless in His glory and peerless in His beauty.

– Charles Spurgeon
