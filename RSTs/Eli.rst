The Gospel
**********

What's Wrong with the Gospel?
=============================
*... Jesus Christ of Nazareth ... crucified but whom God raised from the dead ... salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.* - Acts 4:10,12

There must be something wrong with the Gospel. Otherwise, why would people keep adding to it all the time? Why do would so many try to reshape it to suit their own ideas?

It was simple to begin with. The Lord Jesus came back from the dead and told his followers to share the good news with everyone that he had died for the forgiveness of the sins of the world, of which his resurrection was the proof, so that all who believed in him would live forever.

For some people, the Gospel became more of a social agenda. For other's, it became primarily a community, so if you felt good about the people you worshipped with, then you knew you were on a good thing.

For some, the Gospel became principally a set of ethical standards for living, so that if you followed them you would stand a better chance of salvation.

Perhaps it’s not the Gospel that’s wrong, but it’s us who are wrong. Perhaps what the Gospel is all about was never what we always wanted it to be about. It never was about us and our own agendas.

Listen to the words of this crucified and risen One about how this salvation is offered to all:

    *For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.* - John 3:16

To surrender to this Christ and to this message is to be right in the heart of God. Commit yourself again to the Good News of Jesus today. – Eliezer Gonzalez

God is For Us
=============
*…indeed I am for you* – Ezekiel 36:9, NKJV
 
God spoke these words to the people of Judah, whose city and temple had been destroyed by a cruel foreign nation. He spoke them through Ezekiel, a man who had been deported into slavery.
 
Even when all the evidence seemed to be to the contrary, God says, “I am for you.”
 
Perhaps you are struggling through a terrible divorce. Maybe you are grieving the loss of someone whom you love. Maybe your body is losing the battle against a damaging disease. Maybe you have been betrayed by those who should have cared for you. Perhaps you have just been hurt too much.
 
Or maybe the guilt of your sins and the failures of your past are simply overwhelming you. You may be tempted to think that God is not there.
 
God has a message for you today. “I am for you,” he says. Even if you can’t see it, “I am for you.” “I am for you – even if you are against me – I am still for you. This is the very heart of God’s Good News for us.
 
One of my favourite verses from the Old Testament is::
 
    For the mountains shall depart
    And the hills be removed,
    But My kindness shall not depart from you,
    Nor shall My covenant of peace be removed,”
    Says the Lord, who has mercy on you – Isaiah 54:10, NIV
 
Hold on to that truth in your struggle today – God is for you, not against you. – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Absurdity of the Cross
==========================
*The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God* - 1 Corinthians 1:18
 
The Cross of Jesus is totally absurd to the thinking of the world. Paul calls it “foolishness.” The idea of the Cross was ridiculously counter-cultural in the first century, and it remains so today.
 
No one could have invented the Christian message of the Cross if it weren’t true. Most people ignore the questions the Cross raises, but for those who choose to face them, they are questions that demand answers:

Why didn’t Jesus do something to avoid being crucified?
How did people come to believe, from the beginning, that Jesus could both be God, and be killed by crucifixion?
How did people come to believe from the beginning, that Jesus had risen from the dead, something that had never previously been believed of any man in the Graeco-Roman culture?
How did the Christian message not only survive, but explode upon the world, given that it was so absurd according to the acceptable beliefs of the day?
These questions can only be rationally answered by accepting the message of the Cross: that it is the power of God for our salvation. Nothing explains the Cross except God’s personal intervention to save the world from sin. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus Stayed on the Cross ...
=============================
... **for You!**

*When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified Him there, along with the criminals - one on His right, the other on His left.* - Luke 23:33

Why is it that movies that show the crucifixion of Jesus usually show Him being tied to the cross, in addition to the nails through His hands? That’s not really based on any historical evidence at all. Instead, it’s to make sure that the actor playing Jesus doesn’t hurt himself. It’s all about occupational health and safety.
 
Of course, they can’t really nail the actor to the cross! So they have to have some way to keep him up there, otherwise he’d would just fall down and injure himself. That’s why they use ropes.
 
But the evidence we have from history tells us that Jesus really was nailed to the cross. But it wasn’t the nails that kept Him there. The Bible tells us that the crowd there laughed at Him,
 
    *Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!* - Matthew 27:40

But Jesus stayed on the cross. However, Jesus didn’t stay on the cross because He couldn’t come down, but because He wouldn’t.  What kept Him there? It was the joy of the day when you would accept His sacrifice, and He would give you everlasting life!
 
"Nails could never have kept Him on the cross, but Christ’s love for you is stronger than nails." – Eliezer Gonzalez

You Are Accepted By Christ
==========================
*Christ has accepted you.* - Romans 15:7, CEV
 
People everywhere, and society in general, bombard us continually with subtle – and not-so-subtle – messages telling us that we aren’t acceptable, that we aren’t okay. To be in a relationship where you’re loved, just as we are, is to be in a place of safety, and more than that, a place where you can really know who you are, and where you can feel free to grow.
 
The Bible tells us about how Jesus accepted even those who no one else could accept. People who were rejected by society were acceptable to Him. Jesus came to show us what the Father is like; that the Father’s love is not the kind of watered-down business deal that we call “love” in our world – where it often means “I love you because you’re nice to me.” God’s love for you has no strings attached. The Father’s love is passionately wild and free, relentless in its power, and as endless as eternity itself.
 
That’s why, just as Jesus accepted the unacceptable, the Bible assures us that He has also accepted you (Romans 15:7). Our acceptance is not based on what we do, but on what He has done. That not only applies to God: it's also how we should see our relationships with everyone else.
 
You have nothing to prove that Jesus Christ hasn’t already proven. - Eliezer Gonzalez

Do It For Love
==============
*He saved us, not because of the righteous things we had done, but because of His mercy. He washed away our sins, giving us a new birth and new life through the Holy Spirit.* - Titus 3:5, NLT
 
I have a fear of rollercoasters. Before I got married, my mother-in-law told me that if I wanted to marry her daughter, I had to get on one of those rides. It wasn’t even a full-sized rollercoaster, but it really terrified me. It seemed impossible. But I did it for love.

You find Jesus’ teachings about how we should live summarized in the Sermon on the Mount. And if you read it, you’ll see that the teachings of Jesus cut us all down to size. It seems impossible to live the kind of life that He asks of us. I mean, things like forgiving your enemies look fine on paper, but have you ever tried actually doing it?

And that’s why, in the Bible, the Sermon on the Mount is accompanied by the story of a man with leprosy. This man comes to Jesus and begs for healing. And Jesus heals Him immediately.

He’ll do the same for you. You need Jesus to heal you, and He’ll make you clean immediately. And once He’s done that, then He’ll start to bring out in you, through His Spirit, the kind of life that He taught about.

Christ has already done what you could never do, so whatever you do now, you do for love. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus Will Never Forget You
===========================
*Can a mother forget her nursing child? Can she feel no love for the child she has borne? But even if that were possible, I would not forget you!* - Isaiah 45:19, NLT

I was waiting for an elevator, and when it arrived, the doors opened and a family came out. First dad, and then mum, and they seemed to be in a bit of a hurry.
 
Suddenly I noticed that the lift wasn’t empty. In it there was this tiny little girl – maybe six or seven – and she called out to mum. I looked, and there was also a pram inside, with a baby in it.
 
The little girl tried to hold the doors open, but she was too small and was going to be trapped between the doors. I threw myself at the doors and held them open. By this time, the horrified mum was running back toward the lift.
 
Everything ended well! Mum and pram with baby were reunited. The little girl was safe.
 
It’s true, although it’s difficult to understand, that sometimes mothers forget their babies. Fathers forget their sons. Sisters forget their brothers. Husbands forget their wives. I’m sure that you know what it is to face a broken relationship that should never have been broken.
 
So if you feel forgotten in this crazy world, remember that God will never, ever forget you. Every relationship on earth can fail, but never the love of God for you. He guaranteed that at Calvary. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Christ is Your Representative
=============================
*He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.* - 1 John 2:2

There are some things for which you just need a representative. I had to go to court once, and I needed a good representative.
 
It’s impossible to understand the story of Jesus unless you understand that in everything He did, He was your representative. The Bible puts it this way. Adam and Eve were the representatives of the human race – our first representatives. But they stuffed up, and so we were ruined by our representatives. Then Jesus came into the world as our second representative, and the Bible tells us that,:

    *“one died for all, and therefore all died"* - 2 Corinthians 5:14
 
In other words, you have died to sin on the cross in the person of your representative, Jesus Christ. The debt is paid. And you have also overcome death in the person of your representative, Jesus. We’ve been saved by our Representative. Christ became our representative without our even asking for it, and before we even knew it. He always intended it to be a free gift to all those who would accept His finished work on their behalf.
 
Christ, our Representative, has done what we could never do for ourselves, and has opened wide the gates of heaven so we might go in. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus Was Heaven’s Gift
=======================
*They saw the child with His mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped Him. Then they opened their treasures and presented Him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.* - Matthew 2:11

Unheralded, the Saviour of the World came down to us. In the quiet of the Bethlehem night, He arrived. Though heaven emptied itself as it bestowed its greatest Treasure, no room was found for Him in the inn. Though angels sang, no fanfare announced His glorious arrival.

Although none accepted Him, He accepts all. He came to live among us, to be Immanuel, “God With Us.” Yet He did not come to show us what God is like in power and glory and praise, but in hunger, thirst, loneliness, rejection and pain.

And in the very heart of that revelation to humanity was the greatest gift of all. For all of us are born to live. We strive to live until the end of our days. But He had come to die, and through His victorious death to put an end to death forever.

He had come to a world that slept in ignorance of its need of a Saviour, to be the Saviour of the world. He who deserved only to receive, came only to give. How does one honour a child like this? What gift can we give Him?

Wise men brought Him gifts. But the wisest men of all accept Him as the Gift Himself. – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Grace of God Has No ...
===========================
... **Terms and Conditions**

*This is the only work God wants from you: Believe in the one he has sent.* - John 6:29

After Jesus had miraculously fed five thousand people and walked on the water, the people were pretty impressed with him, and so they asked him what they needed to do, to do the works that God required of them (v.28).

You know those ads on radio that say at the end, “Terms and Conditions apply”? Sometimes ads will even offer you a free gift with "Terms and Conditions". But that’s not really a gift, is it? A gift has got to be free or it’s no gift at all.
 
The message of Christianity is that there are no Terms and Conditions to the grace of God.
 
We’re so used to Terms and Conditions, that we just assume they’re there somewhere. We can fall into the trap of thinking that if we try hard enough or live good enough lives, then we’ll get into God’s good books.

But it doesn’t work that way. The Bible says that,

    *... it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.*

There are no Terms and Conditions here, because Jesus met them all on our behalf on the Cross. All you need to do is to accept the gift, and he will do the rest. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Salvation is a Done Deal
========================
*And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.* - 1 Corinthians 6:10

Two thousand years ago all your sins were forgiven, you were given a free pass into the Kingdom of God, and you were granted eternal life. The New Testament tells you this again and again, including in 1 Corinthians 6:10. It is a gift you simply receive today.

Sin has been dealt with in our lives through the once-for-all and totally sufficient sacrifice of Christ (Hebrews 10:12–14). Through it we have been made perfect forever at Calvary. Because of that, we are now being made holy.

The greatest benefit of salvation is the gift of the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 1:13-14), who assures us that when Christ said, “Father, forgive them,” his prayer was answered. The Holy Spirit guarantees to us that when Christ cried out, “It is finished!,” it really was finished — two thousand years ago, at Calvary. He accomplished this complete salvation for the world (John 3:16). It is an historical fact. It is received by faith in Jesus Christ (Romans 3:22). Your salvation depends on it.

We are not to wring our hands and worry about our salvation. Instead we are to celebrate and to hold on to the gift we have already been given (Hebrews 10:23). – Eliezer Gonzalez

Christ Has Won ...
==================
... **the War on Terror**

*I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.* - John 16:33, NIV

Many people everywhere are fearful as they look at the growth of extremism and terror around the world. We will never understand the great problems of this world unless we understand the spiritual nature of the war in which we are involved (Ephesians 6:12). The only one who can solve them is Jesus Christ.

Christ has already defeated the enemy, both in the world and within ourselves. The decisive battle for this world has been fought and won by Jesus at Calvary. The Cross was the battle that has ushered in the Kingdom of God. There, Christ has faced the greatest terror and overcome! That is what we announce as messengers of the Kingdom. The Gospel is the Good News that there is no terror – now or forever – for those who are in Christ.

We are not caught by surprise like those who don’t believe, and we do not despair. Christ told us that we would have trouble, but that even in the midst of it we would have peace, because he has overcome.

So, we take heart! Through Christ’s victory at the Cross, God has already won the war on terror. There’s no place for fear in your life any more, if you trust in Christ. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus: ...
==========
... **the Ultimate Evidence for God**

*In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son.* - Hebrews 1:1–2, NIV

Until the coming of Jesus into the world, humanity sought for God, as if grasping at shadows. God had revealed himself, “through the prophets”; in other words, always through an intermediary and not directly.
 
I have a friend who gave up believing in God, and the reason he gave me was that if a loving God existed, he would have revealed himself directly to my friend. However, that’s precisely what God has done!
 
When people asked Jesus for evidence, he told them that he was the ultimate evidence for God:
 
    *Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.” Jesus answered: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.”* John 14:8–9, NIV

God decided to come and live with us for “such a long time,” as one of us (Matthew 1:23). Isn’t that so much better than appearing in some vision or dream to an individual? Jesus did what God could do, and that included obtaining forgiveness for the entire world at Calvary, and defeating death forever.

Jesus is the ultimate evidence for God. What greater evidence could anyone ever want? – Eliezer Gonzalez

It Was Just the Beginning!
==========================

*In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach.* - Acts 1:1, NIV

Do you ever wonder what Jesus is doing right now? Where is he when you need him?

The words in the verse above are the ones with which Luke begins his second book about what Jesus did. This first book was of course the gospel that bears his name, and this second book is called the Acts of the Apostles. The Gospel of Luke is about “all that Jesus began to do and to teach.” The Acts of the Apostles is about all that Jesus continued to do and to teach “after his suffering” (v.3).

What this means is that although his suffering for your sin (the atonement) is finished, Jesus’ work in this world or in your life is not finished yet. The story of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection is only the beginning of your own story, which he carefully continues to craft.

Jesus is alive! He is still at work today! His story is not a story of the past, but a story of today!

Will you allow Jesus to continue to work in your life? Accept him again as your Lord and Saviour, and thank him because he hasn’t finished with you yet, and that he has chosen you to be part of his story. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Avoid the Dull Mind ...
=======================
... **of Unbelief**

*Then Jesus said to them, “You foolish people! Your dull minds keep you from believing all that the prophets talked about.”* - Luke 24:25, CEB

Jesus was not talking to just the two disciples; he was talking to **everyone**.

Jesus was not telling them that they needed to see him in the Old Testament. He was telling them that they needed understand that he was the whole point, hero, and reason, front and centre, foundation and object, of the entire Scriptures.

Jesus was not telling them that they needed to understand the Messianic prophecies (in other words the “Messianic” parts of the Old Testament), he was telling them that they needed to understand his Cross and victory as the point of it all; in other words, Jesus was telling them that they needed to understand the Gospel.

These people had been taught to read the Scriptures and to see in them anything but the Gospel. They saw history and moral instruction; they saw intellectual theology and wisdom, but they had missed the Gospel.

It’s time to stop being foolish and dull. When you read the Bible and see the Gospel, your heart will burn within you with excitement! It’s time to read the Scriptures afresh! But we will only ever be able to understand them if the Christ of Emmaus is walking alongside us to open our eyes. Then, an exciting new beginning will come into your life! – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus is the True Bread...
==========================
... **from Heaven**

*Moses didn’t give you bread from heaven… The true bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.* - John 6:32–33, NLT

In Exodus 16:14–22, we read the story of how God sent manna to feed his people in the wilderness. This was bread from heaven (v.15), and it represented the grace of Jesus, the One who would come and be the true Bread from Heaven (John 6:41).

Manna was sweet. You may have experienced bitterness in your life, maybe even right now, but Jesus gives you his grace.

The children of Israel needed to collect the manna every day. You need to receive the grace of God every day.

Manna was free. No one had to work for it. You didn’t have to go looking for it. It was just there at your doorstep. All you had to do was to go and pick it up and look up to heaven and say, “Thanks!” That’s how grace comes to you. You can’t work for the gift of Christ.

Manna was enough. Everyone received what they needed, and it was always enough. The grace of God will always be more than sufficient for your needs.

Some of the Children of Israel tried of find manna in their own way, with tragic consequences. It doesn’t work that way.

The Bread of Life is there for us every day, free, and always meets our needs. It’s what gives us true life. – Eliezer Gonzalez

.. _eg-Forgiveness:

Forgiveness
***********

The Man Who Wouldn't ...
========================
... **Accept Forgiveness**

*The servant’s master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go* - Matthew 18:27

I have always wondered about what the parable of the unmerciful servant in Matthew 18. Here is a man who is seemingly forgiven but apparently loses his forgiveness when he fails to forgive another.

This parable may be all about a man who would not accept the forgiveness of God.

This man owed an unimaginably large sum to his master. He is dragged before the master, and the parable says that he begged to be given a chance:

   *the servant fell on his knees before him. ‘Be patient with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’* - Matthew 18:26

The master then goes way beyond what his servant asks, and cancels the entire debt!

   *Then, when immediately following this, the servant failed to forgive his fellow servant a much smaller debt, the master recalls him and makes him liable for the entire debt.* (v.34).

The fact that this servant would not forgive another is the clear demonstration that he had never accepted his master’s forgiveness in the first place. Not only had he not understood it, but he did not accept it, and he consequently failed to pass it on.

The way we forgive others is a reflection of whether we have accepted the forgiveness of our sins by God. One of the most important questions we will ever need to answer is whether we have accepted the forgiveness of our sins in Christ.

Have you? Who do you need to forgive whole-heartedly today? – Eliezer Gonzalez

Don't Stub Your Toe!
====================
One of the most excruciating every-day pains one can feel is when you stub your toe against something. Although it’s been a while since I did that last, I still remember the agony. You’d be crazy to kick that thing again in the hope that the pain would go away, wouldn’t you?
 
This reminds me of the expression “to kick against the pricks” from the Bible.
 
“To kick against the pricks” was a familiar proverb at the time when the New Testament of the Bible was written. It is commonly associated with the story of the conversion of the apostle Paul. If you don’t know it, it’s because most modern translations don’t have it; however it is reflected in the King James Version of Acts 9:5:
 
   *And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, 'I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.'*

This is a reference to how farmers in ancient times would use an ox goad to prod the oxen when plowing. The goad was a stick with a pointed piece of iron on its tip. The sharp iron was “the prick.” If the ox kicked against the goad, that was what it meant to “kick against the prick.” The more the ox rebelled, the more that it suffered.
 
I have found this to be true in my life. The truth about the Gospel is that I have kicked against the pricks all my life, until I have finally understood the meaning of what Paul finally also understood, that:

   *In Him [Christ] we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace.* – Ephesians 1:7.
 
Jesus challenges you also. He says to you, “It’s hard to kick against the pricks, isn’t it?"
Perhaps it’s time to stop and rest. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Bookkeeping Christianity
========================
*He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son does not have life* – 1 John 5:12

Christianity can get complicated if you allow it. Take, for example, the questions, "If once you accepted the grace and forgiveness of Christ into your life, and then you reject salvation, for what sins will you perish? Will they include the sins that were once forgiven?"

Dissecting Matthewers in that way could be called "bookkeeping Christianity." It’s not New Testament Christianity. The only question that Matthewers is if we have accepted the love of the Father. If you have, then nothing else Matthewers.

The forgiveness that God offers us is real! God blots out our transgressions, he remembers them no more (Isaiah 43:25), he casts them into the depths of the sea! (Micah 7:19).

Too often we love to do bookkeeping about our own salvation, and especially about the salvation of others. But God simplifies everything.

This is the most important question you will ever be asked: Do you have the Son?

If you do, then let’s stop doing bookkeeping and let’s start living today! – Eliezer Gonzalez

God’s Undo Button
=================
I’ve experienced the sheer panic – that sudden sinking feeling in your gut – when you’ve pressed “send” on an email that should never have been sent. Oops!
 
If only there had been a way to recall it! We’ve probably all been there and done that at some stage, wishing for an “undo” button.
 
But God has a far better “undo” option than anything on your computer.
 
At the Cross, the one who was God With Us cried out, *“Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do”* (Luke 23:34). With those words, forgiveness and perfection of life flowed out from Calvary over the whole world, to be freely received by all those who would accept the gift. That’s God’s “undo” option.
 
There’s a lot of things I wish could just go away in my life – choices I’ve made, and things I’ve said and done. I wish I could have lived a better life. But the Bible says that:

   *God made him (Jesus) who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.* – 2 Corinthians 5:21
 
Because of Jesus, all your yesterdays can be undone, and all your tomorrows can overflow with joy. – Eliezer Gonzalez

In the Centre of God’s Love
===========================
*I have loved you, my people, with an everlasting love. With unfailing love I have drawn you to myself* – Jeremiah 31:3
 
I’m fortunate that I’ve never been in one of those huge cyclones that hit in North Queensland, or in one of those tornadoes in the US. The closest I’ve ever come was when I was a kid growing up in Sydney, and I remember a mini-cyclone that hit the city.
 
I was out on the street, and there was wind blowing everywhere; then suddenly there was silence and peace as the sky directly above me went still, while the dark clouds raged around. I didn’t know it, but I was in right in the centre of the storm.
 
Right now you are in the centre of that everlasting love, however much a failure you may feel. No Matthewer how stormy your life might be, you can have peace.
 
God’s forgiveness is unbounded. He says:

   *"How can I give you up? I have loved you with an everlasting love. Come to me, and I will give you rest. My peace I give to you, not as the world gives. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."*
 
Des Ford writes that, “There is infinite joy in a moment when you accept God's acceptance of you.” Believe it and receive it. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Better Than Anything ...
========================
... **You Could Imagine**

*O Lord, you are so good, so ready to forgive, so full of unfailing love for all who ask for your help.* - Psalm 86:5

I couldn’t have dreamt up God, not in a million years!

No atheist could conceive of a God as good, as merciful, as compassionate, and as loving, as the God of the Bible, and as the God who has revealed himself to you and me. No mind that was formed as the result of the random collisions of molecules over millions of years could dream up such pure goodness as God is.

And more, no religion that has ever existed on the face of the earth has ever conceived of such a God as is revealed in Jesus Christ. Other religions can conceive of perfection, justice, and law, but never have they conceived of such a compassionate love as the story of Jesus reveals. As Martin Luther King said,
 
    When I look at myself I wonder how I could ever be saved.

    When I look at God I wonder how I could ever be lost.
 
For me, the fact that the goodness of the character of God is so far beyond what my mind can imagine is evidence for the existence of God. He’s a God who’s worthy of your love, and to whom you can entrust your life. – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Best Spoiler Ever
=====================
*Take heart! I have overcome the world.* - John 16:33

Don’t you hate it when someone spoils the end of a movie for you! Especially when there’s a massive twist right at the end. There’s nothing worse! That’s why spoilers usually come with a warning, because people would rather not know them.
 
But here’s a spoiler alert you’ll want to know! The spoiler that God gives to those of us who are doing life on earth, is one that makes getting to the end all worthwhile. It’s found clearly in the Bible, and it’s all good news!
 
Here it is: Jesus wins! It’s not just some future promise, but a present reality to hold on to. Jesus never said “I will win.” Instead, he says, “Take heart! I have overcome the world.” When Jesus died on the Cross, he snatched victory over suffering and pain and death. And here is his promise:
 
I will wipe every tear from your eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.
 
Because we know that our sins have been forgiven, and we know that we have been given eternal life, we can face whatever life throws at us now. Most of all, you can know with confidence that God’s tomorrows will always be better than your todays. – Eliezer Gonzalez

How Forgiveness Works ...
=========================
... **in the Kingdom**

*Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.* - Ephesians 4:32

I once owed a friend a whole lot of money, and I knew that I couldn’t pay it back. I lay awake at night tossing and turning, and just thinking about it. What did this friend do? He signed a paper called a “debt forgiveness” and he gave it to me, so that I wouldn’t worry about it again. I slept better after that!

Jesus said that the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who owed an impossible amount of money (Matthew 18:23–35). And the man to whom he owed it, incredibly forgave him the whole debt! But then the man in the story failed to forgive another guy who owed him only a few dollars.
 
Every one of us has failed to live the kind of way that God wants us to live. It’s as if we owed a debt to God. We are all sinners.
 
But that’s not the worst thing in the world. The worst thing in the world is if we reject the forgiveness that God offers us through Jesus Christ. And how we treat others will show whether we have accepted or rejected God’s forgiveness.
 
And that’s the moral of Jesus’ story: in the Kingdom of Heaven, forgiven people forgive. – Eliezer Gonzalez

God is Not a Heavenly Bookkeeper
================================
*While he was still a long way off, his father saw him coming. Filled with love and compassion, he ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him.* - Luke 15:20

I’m glad the father in Jesus’ story about the prodigal son wasn’t a bookkeeper, because he represents what God is like.

Years ago, I worked as a real estate agent. One day I wrote a contract for the sale of a house, and I added an extra zero to the price! It wasn’t intentional. It’s just that numbers are not my particular talent. Thankfully my mistake was picked up by the solicitor and no harm was done other than to my ego.

That’s why I love accountants and bookkeepers. I mean, where would I be without them!

But my question is this: is God is some kind of bookkeeper up in heaven, balancing good deeds against bad deeds?

The New Testament teaches us that there is only one question that matters. Have you accepted the love of the Father? The Father has shown us His love by giving us His Son, Jesus Christ.
 
Sometimes Christians like to do some bookkeeping on their own salvation, and even on others. But there’s no place for that kind of bookkeeping in Christianity.
 
The Bible tells us that,

    *He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son does not have life.* – 1 John 5:12

If you have the Son, nothing else matters. It really is that simple! – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus Can Forgive Even ...
==========================
... **Your Greatest Sin!**

*Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they do.* - Luke 23:34

Because He died for the sins of the world, Jesus wasn’t thinking just of the people who had physically crucified Him. He was thinking of a lost and broken world. He wasn’t thinking of Himself. He was thinking of you.

It’s only human to sometimes doubt God, and to question whether He even thinks about us. At those times, remember Christ’s words at Calvary. If Christ thought about you then, surely He is thinking about you now.

When Jesus asks the Father to forgive us, the reason that He gives is, “for they don’t know what they do.”

However, in the days before His death, Jesus had in effect told the Jews that they knew what they were doing. Their sin was all the greater because they had been given light and they claimed to understand it (e.g. John 9:35-41). How could He now forgive them?

Like us, those who crucified Him knew in part, and in part they didn’t know. But Christ’s great heart of love looks with mercy on our ignorance and weakness, in His willingness to forgive even the greatest of all sins (Mark 3:28). How is this possible? Because the Cross brings together the greatest sin (2 Cor 5:21), and the greatest love – and love won. – Eliezer Gonzalez

How David Learnt Forgiveness
============================
*Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions. Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.* - Psalm 51:1–2 NIV

When David, the future king of Israel, was young, he thought he understood about forgiveness, but he didn’t. Like so many of us, he learnt forgiveness the hard way. David learnt his need of forgiveness when later in life he awoke one day and realised what he had become – a lustful adulterer and a vile murder. In his great Psalm of repentance he cried out to God,

    *Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.* Psalm 51
 
David learnt the cost of forgiveness when, later, his own son rebelled against him. On learning of Absalom’s death,

    *The king was overcome with emotion. He went up to the room over the gateway and burst into tears. And as he went, he cried, “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you! O Absalom, my son, my son.”* 2 Samuel 18:33 NLT

From David’s life we learn the two great lessons of forgiveness: how free it is from God, and how costly it was to God. We are forgiven only because of God’s mercy and compassion. We are forgiven because God gave us his one and only Son, who died at Calvary.

There is nothing more important in life than learning your need of forgiveness, and its cost. – Eliezer Gonzalez

How Moses Learnt Forgiveness
============================
*But now, please forgive their sin — but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written.* - Exodus 32:32, NIV

The hardest lesson that the great men and women of God have always had to learn is the lesson of forgiveness: what it means to be forgiven, and what it means to forgive. Moses learnt that lesson, like all of us do, the hard way.

At the foot of Mount Sinai, as God is about to wipe out the idolatrous and rebellious people of Israel, Moses interposes his own life between the people and God, and intercedes for them. At the foot of Sinai, Moses learnt that forgiveness has a cost.

Then forty years later, Moses, now an old man, in his anger at the people of Israel, strikes the rock instead of speaking to it as the Lord had commanded. There at the borders of Canaan, Moses learnt that he would always need the forgiveness of God himself, no matter how long he had followed him.

Forgiveness has a cost: the life of the Son of God. And you will need forgiveness for as long as you live. When you learn these lessons of forgiveness, they transform your life. Then God will also be able to say of you, as he said of Moses, that you are the meekest, most humble person on earth (Numbers 12:3). The lessons of forgiveness are the ones that open the gates of Paradise. – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Longest Silence
===================
*O God, do not remain quiet; Do not be silent and, O God, do not be still.* - Psalm 83:1, NASB

The longest silence was when that woman who was a foreigner followed Jesus along the road, crying out, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! (Matthew 15:22)

The longest silence was when the crowd cried for the blood of the immoral woman thrown at Jesus’ feet.

The longest silence was when they had brutally nailed Jesus to the timbers, and they raised him up high. What would he say?

    *“Father, forgive them, for they know now what they do.”* Luke 23:34

There will be times when you also will go through what seems to be your own time of ‘longest silence’, and when it seems that God is absent, and you are alone in that silence. But it is not God who is silent; it’s just our hearts that need tuning to his frequency of love. Listen to it now:

    *But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in his name.* John 1:12, NKJV

The longest silence of all was that Friday when they placed him in a tomb behind a rock. They thought he would never again be heard. But on that Sunday the whole world heard his voice.

You are forgiven. You are accepted. You are loved. You are his. – Eliezer Gonzalez

God Focuses on the Heart
========================
*For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.* - Matthew 6:21, NIV

It’s natural for us to focus on the externals—things we can see, hear, touch, and try to control. However, the teachings of Jesus overwhelmingly focus on the heart. Jesus directly and consistently rebuked those whose religious teachings were focused on the externals.

Jesus knew that a transformed heart leads to a transformed life, and never the other way around. He taught a Gospel that emphasised God’s radical love for his wayward children. It is a love that can melt and transform the hardest heart. From such a heart will come the kind of Kingdom life that pleases God.

Without a radical transformation of the heart, the externals are meaningless, and even dangerous in the extreme. To focus on any other kind of “gospel” is to be like the white-washed sepulchres of the Pharisees — seemingly nice and shiny on the outside, but putrid and stinking of corruption on the inside (Matthew 23:27–28).

Jesus was very clear that what defiles us is not the externals, but those things that come out from our hearts (Matthew 15:1–20; Matthew 23:27–28).

If your heart is right with God, the rest will follow. If it isn’t, then you will struggle all your life, attempting to live a life that you will never be able to live. And you will lose your soul. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Forgiveness is ...
==================
... **The Heart of the Gospel**

*In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace that he lavished on us.* - Ephesians 1:7–8, NIV

Forgiveness is the beating heart of the Gospel. It is what pumps its life-giving power throughout the world. In fact, the Gospel is all about forgiveness. Everything else that the Gospel is about stems from forgiveness.

It’s taken me a long time to realise this truth. That’s because all of my religious experience was about the Gospel being something difficult to understand. And it’s because all my life I was taught that we get what we deserve. *Well, we don’t*. Not from God when we are under his grace.

I used to think that the Bible was all about the grandest sweep of history, and grand philosophy and prophecy, and about advice about how to live. But while all those things are there, that’s not what the Bible is all about. The Bible, from the beginning to the end, is all about God’s forgiving grace (Isaiah 53; Luke 1:76–78; 3:1–3; Acts 2:38; 13:38–40).
 
Let’s not complicate the Gospel. We need to see afresh the sacrificial love of Christ, so that we can understand that what we need is forgiveness, and then we need to simply accept it as God’s gracious gift. And everything else just flows from there. – Eliezer Gonzalez

A Different Kind of Love
========================

*But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.* - Romans 5:8, NIV

What’s your experience of love been? If love were a shop, would you go there again?

Beyond the fairy-tale illusions of childhood, most people only ever know love as a constant tug-of-war in which you only ever feel “loved” if you give in return. And too often our hearts are crushed underfoot.

But all models of human love are basically flawed. Calvary is God’s earth-shattering revelation of a new reality that he brings into the world. The apostle Paul describes it in Romans 5:8. The word “but” means that this is *different* to any other kind of love.

The word “demonstrates” means that God doesn’t just tell us about his love. He has demonstrated it. The love of God has been demonstrated as an historical and relational reality, so that none can doubt it, and all can experience it.

The phrase “his own love” means that this love is as elevated from all human forms of love as the furthest stars are from the earth. God demonstrated it at Calvary. God didn’t wait until we changed our lives, improved our characters or reformed ourselves. While we were still sinners, he died for us. The shepherd went out to look for his lost sheep, the father of the prodigal ran down the road to welcome us home. 

That’s true love. – Eliezer Gonzalez

.. _eg-Challenges:

Challenges of Life
******************

Walk on Water Today!
====================
*“Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.”
“Come,” he said.
Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?”* - Matthew 14:28–31
 
Peter is the only man who ever walked on water. He had enough faith in Jesus to do so, but he was human and when his faith was tested by the elements it wavered and he sank. However, it was his faith in Jesus that saved him.
 
When Jesus calls you to walk on water you can achieve the impossible through faith in him. It may be a wavering faith, it may be a stumbling faith; it may even be a doubting faith. That’s why your walk may not be perfect; at times you may even sink beneath the waves. However, faith, even faith as small as a mustard seed, is what you need to walk on water. And Jesus will always be there to reach out with his hand when you stumble.
 
Others may remain in the security of the boat, but that’s not where the most exhilarating joy of the Kingdom of God is to be found. If you make Jesus your security he will enable you to accomplish the impossible through faith in him.
 
Think about the challenges that are facing you. Are you trusting in the Lord to walk on water today? Spend some time listening to his voice, and affirm your faith in him. – Eliezer Gonzalez and Ritchie Way

God Wants to Be Real To You
===========================
*This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us* – 1 John 5:14
 
You never really know someone until you meet them and speak with them, do you? I was born in Switzerland and grew up in Australia. I always knew that I had many relatives in Spain, where my parents came from, but until I met them, they weren’t “real” to me. A similar thing happened with Samuel:

   *Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord: The word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him… The Lord came and stood there, calling as at the other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” Then Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening”* – 1 Samuel 3:7,10
 
Samuel didn’t know God until he spoke with him. Similarly, Job says:

   *My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you* – Job 42:5
                         
Prayer is real communication with God. When you speak with him, he speaks to your heart in ways that the spiritual person will hear and understand.
 
God has a million ways of telling you he loves you. All you need to do is listen. There are many strong, logical arguments and good evidence to support the existence of God, but God won’t be “real” to you until you’ve met him.
 
How do I know that God exists? I was just speaking with him this morning. – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Only Life That Satisfies
============================
*In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind* - John 1:4

If we believe that God exists, then we can also predict that, apart from him, humanity will have a restless desire for something more. Pascal wrote of how: 

    “There is a god-shaped vacuum in the heart of every man, and only God can fill it.”
    
C.S. Lewis said it like this,
 
    Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food… If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.
 
Many atheists have also recognized the existence of a restless, unfulfilled desire for something more. For example, the atheist philosopher Bertrand Russell acknowledged that:

    “The centre of me is always and eternally a terrible pain - a curious wild pain - a searching for something beyond what the world contains.”

Our secular culture is relentless in its failed pursuit of fulfillment apart from God. All of this points to the truth of the ancient words:

    *This is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent* - John 17:3

Only in Christ can you find true life; anything else is worthless. – Eliezer Gonzalez

God Puts Beauty in Your Life
============================
*He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end* - Ecclesiastes 3:11
 
I love the magnificent beauty of a sunset over the ocean. I live on the east coast of Australia so we don’t get sunsets over the ocean, but I will never forget my stay in Chile in 1997, when I would rush to the seashore to catch the sunset at every opportunity I could get.
 
I love the fragile beauty of a rose, and the fragrance that it shares. I’m not much of a gardener, but I did grow a red rose bush some years ago. I was so excited to get several perfect roses, and after that the rose bush died!
 
I love the powerful beauty of the choral music of the Baroque composers like Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi. It simply transports me to another place that is far from the everyday.
 
I’m sure you have your own list of beautiful things that you love also.
 
Why do we practically universally recognize what is beautiful? Why do we recognize beauty even when we haven’t seen it before, and couldn’t even have described it before? Where does this come from? Science can’t properly explain beauty, because this is something beyond science. This has to do with a Mind beyond our own.
 
Beauty comes from the One who is altogether beautiful, and the author of all that is good. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus Handles Your Storms
=========================
*He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace, be still!” And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.* - Mark 4:39

You’ve heard of storm chasers, haven’t you? They’re the people who instead of running away from massive storms, jump in their cars and drive toward them! 
 
I reckon Jesus Christ is the ultimate Storm Chaser. He never avoided the storms, at his birth, during his life, and at his death. Wherever he went, Jesus infuriated the self-righteous, the oppressors, and the unmerciful. Jesus never sought out controversy for his own sake either, but for the sake of the lost, the downtrodden, and the oppressed.
 
But more than that, Jesus died in the midst of a storm. There was darkness and an earthquake, but those were just representations of the greater storm that raged there. The Cross was the greatest storm that ever raged, between good and evil, love and hatred.  It was the eye of the storm for your soul – and Jesus won!
 
You don’t have to chase storms in your life. You can bet they’ll come to you.
 
But when you’re feeling like you’re in the eye of the storm, remember that Jesus has already handled it for you! After all, Jesus has already handled death and resurrection for you. What more could you need than Jesus? You’re not alone. – Eliezer Gonzalez

How Not To Miss Your Flight
===========================
*Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.* - Matthew 25:34

I once missed a flight because I didn’t read the departure time on my ticket. It’s not what I had done that got me in trouble, instead it’s what I hadn’t done that was the problem. I felt like a goat.
 
Jesus told a story about sheep and goats. The sheep are the people who get His tick of approval, and they hear those great words above spoken to them by the King.
 
But the goats don’t get His tick of approval at all. The problem with the goats is not what they did, but what they didn’t do. They didn’t feed the hungry, care for the sick, and look after the most vulnerable people around them.
 
Too many people think that what they do will stop them from being lost, but when you look at life through this story of Jesus, none of us have much to boast about. All of us fail to do much that we should do.
 
You are lost, not just by what you’ve done, but also by what you haven’t done. You are saved, not what you’ve done, but by what Christ alone has done.
 
This should cause us to throw ourselves completely into the arms of our loving Saviour, because you wouldn’t want to miss your flight! – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Secret to Happiness
=======================
*Give “joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of His holy people in the kingdom of light”.* - Colossians 1:12

Many people pursue happiness as the object of life. Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote,

    Happiness in this world, when it comes, comes incidentally. Make it the object of pursuit, and it leads us a wild-goose chase, and is never attained. Follow some other object and very possibly we may find that we have caught happiness without dreaming of it.
 
The Bible tells us what we must pursue in order to achieve happiness. Happiness only comes as we accept God’s grace.
 
The word “grace” comes from a Greek word xaris. This word comes from a root meaning "to be joyful," and so the word “grace” is always associated with happiness and joy.
 
Grace means that God is for us even when we are against Him. It refers to the active love of God streaming over us as continually and as generously as the sunshine from the sun. Grace is God’s unimaginable generosity.
 
Happiness is not found in what we do, but in trusting in God’s goodness.  It’s not in what we take, but in how much we share. It’s not in what we get from others, but in what we freely receive from God. It’s not in our circumstances, but in what God provides.
 
Receive the grace of God, and happiness undreamed of will come your way. – Eliezer Gonzalez

God Will Fill You To Overflowing
================================
*May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in Him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.* - Romans 15:13, NIV

Did you know that the universe is 99.999% empty space? And that means our bodies as well. That means that if you took away all of the space between the atoms in our bodies, the whole human race would take up the space of a sugar cube. That’s because our bodies are 99.999% empty space.
 
I’m sure that we have all felt empty at some stage or another, and now you know why!
 
It makes you wonder what there is about people to love. God knows the answer, literally, because He tells us through the Bible that we are deeply, desperately, and continuously loved. If death were the end of it all, then that’s all we are – just empty space. But death isn’t the end! The Bible says that in God’s

    *"great mercy, He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."* – 1 Peter 1:3.
 
Because Jesus has overcome death, when you believe in Him, He fills you with new life that’s full of joy and hope and purpose. He fills you with eternity.
 
When you trust in Him, God fills you to overflowing, through the Holy Spirit, with joy and peace. God fills all your empty spaces and turns them into joy. He fills you with eternity. – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Cross Was Not The End
=========================
*In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach.* - Acts 1:1

The words in the verse above are the ones with which Luke begins his second book about what Jesus did. This first book was of course the gospel that bears his name, and this second book is called the Acts of the Apostles. The Gospel of Luke is about “all that Jesus began to do and to teach.” The Acts of the Apostles is about all that Jesus continued to do and to teach “after His suffering” (v.3).
 
What this means is that although His suffering for your sin (the atonement) is finished, Jesus’ work in this world and in your life is not finished yet. The story of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection is only the beginning of your own story, which He carefully continues to craft.
 
Jesus is alive! He is still at work today! His story is not a story of the past, but a story of today and forever! The Cross was not the end; it was only the beginning. In the same way, Jesus hasn’t finished with you yet! He has chosen you to be part of His story. 

In God’s story, the things that seem to be the end are only the beginning, and they lead to eternal glory. – Eliezer Gonzalez

There’s No Need to Wait
=======================
*What are you waiting for? ... Have your sins washed away by calling on the Name of the Lord.* - Acts 22:16, NLT
 
It was a long wait when that woman who was a foreigner followed Jesus along the road, crying out:

    *Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David!* - Matt. 15:22

For a time, He answered her not a word.
 
It was a long wait when the crowd cried for the blood of the immoral woman thrown at Jesus’ feet. And He remained silent while He wrote on the ground (John 8:6–7). And all the while, the woman wondered.
 
It was a long wait was when they had brutally nailed Jesus to the timbers, and they raised Him up high. What would He say?

    *Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.* - Luke 23:34
 
During your life, you will go through times of apparent silence. But it is not God who is silent; it’s just our hearts that need tuning to His frequency of love. Listen to it now. The longest silence occurred on that Friday when they placed Him in a tomb behind a rock. They thought He would never again be heard. But on the Sunday, the whole world heard His voice.
 
You are forgiven. You are accepted. You are His. There’s no longer any need to wait. – Eliezer Gonzalez

You Will Be Satisfied ...
=========================
... **in the Kingdom of God**

*I am the bread of life: He that comes to me shall never hunger; and He that believes on me shall never thirst.* - John 6:35

I once saw two photos. In the first one, all the possessions of a typical family in the USA were piled up on their front lawn, and it was an enormous pile! In the second photo, all the possessions of a typical family in the third world were spread out on a single blanket.
 
At the end of their lives, most people wish that they could have another day, week, or even another minute of time with their loved ones. What matters most is not the stuff, but the people. The trap of falling into the rat race is that you never become satisfied. It tells you that you were never chasing the right thing to start with.
 
That’s why Jesus tells us firstly who He is: He is the “bread of life”; the Source. And then Jesus tells us what He can do for us: “he that comes to Me shall never hunger; and he that believes on Me shall never thirst.” Christ is the One who satisfies, and nothing else will do.
 
Jesus tells us to put Him and His Kingdom first, and then we’ll have everything we need, and more. Because in His Kingdom, there’s always much more than enough. – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Kingdom of Heaven ...
=========================
... **is Not Just a Future Hope**

*The thief’s purpose is to steal and kill and destroy. My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life.* - John 10:10, NLT

Jesus told a story about ten young ladies who were invited to a wedding (Matt 25:1–13).  Five of them only focused on the future wedding, and the other five were also focused on what they needed to be doing right now.
 
The five who were focused on the future didn’t bring enough oil for their lamps while they waited. The other five were just as excited about the wedding, but their joy spilt over into their present, so that they remembered to bring enough oil. The Bridegroom surprised them all!
 
There’s a kind of Christian who is always miserable and gloomy, and all that they do is look forward to the better times that God will bring. Some of them try to trace out every detail of Bible prophecy, to work out exactly how the end will come. But the Bridegroom will surprise us all.
 
Jesus has promised us that things will be better in the future. But if that’s all we have, and we are just waiting in misery for that day, then we are like those girls without oil. The Kingdom of Heaven is not alone a future hope, but a present reality.

Only those who live profitably and joyfully in Christ’s Kingdom now will ever come to see the Kingdom of Glory. – Eliezer Gonzalez

There’s No Difference ...
=========================
... **Between Us in the Kingdom**

*There is no difference ... the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him.* - Romans 10:12

Albert Einstein once said, “I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university.” Although we’re all individuals, there’s some good advice here.
 
I’ve been to a few countries around the world and made friends with lots of different kinds of people. And one thing that I have learnt is that people everywhere are basically all the same.  We all have the same dreams, the same things make us happy, and the same things make us sad.
 
The Bible also tells us that there’s basically no difference between us all. In fact there’s two verses that talk about this.
 
One says, "There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:22-23). That’s bad news.
 
The other verse says, "There is no difference ... the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on Him" (Romans 10:12). And that’s really good news!
 
The blessing that the Lord has for us all is the forgiveness of sin and the gift of eternal life. This is His gift for all who believe, and it is that same gift that underscores our equality in the Kingdom of Heaven. There are no first or second-class seats at the foot of the Cross. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus Wants To Focus on Our Hearts
==================================
*These people honour me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.* - Matthew 15:8 NIV

There’s nothing more annoying than a car that won’t start when you need it to. It happened to me recently with a car I bought that seemed a real bargain. It’s easy to paint a dodgy car up and make it look good, while not bothering to fix it on the inside, where it matters most.

Although we try and try, we’re still not the husbands, the wives, the sons, the daughters, the friends that we could be or should be. Perhaps it’s because we focus too often on externals, such as our behaviours, rather than on what matters most. The Jewish teachers insisted on lots of ritual hand-washing. But Jesus taught that it’s not the germs from the outside, but our hearts on the inside that cause our problems:

    *The things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the heart, and these defile them. For out of the heart come evil thoughts — murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.* - Matthew 15:18–19

Jesus taught that if our hearts are right, then our behaviour will be right. That’s why the teachings of Jesus overwhelmingly focus on the heart.
 
God isn’t primarily interested in the externals. He cleans you from the inside out. If your heart is right with God, the rest will follow. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Knocked Down But Not Out
========================
*We are experiencing all kinds of trouble, but we aren’t crushed. We are confused, but we aren’t depressed. We are harassed, but we aren’t abandoned. We are knocked down, but we aren’t knocked out.* - 2 Corinthians 4:8–9, CEB

If there were ever anyone who had reason to complain about their life, Paul of Tarsus would have been the one. In 2 Corinthians 11:23–27, he writes about how many times he has been thrown in prison, beaten, flogged within an inch of his life, stoned, shipwrecked, and betrayed. He says that he has gone without sleep, food, drink, and warmth, and he has faced dangers everywhere.

Still, Paul’s faith stays strong! How do you get to have a faith like that? Paul goes on to explain that,

    *We do this because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus… We don’t focus on the things that can be seen but on the things that can’t be seen. The things that can be seen don’t last, but the things that can’t be seen are eternal.* - 2 Corinthians 4:14,18

Let’s face facts. Life can be tough ... really tough. It is a miracle of grace that any of us will get out of it alive!

Hold on to the fact that you will be raised with Jesus. Focus on the eternal things that can’t be seen. Hold on to them by faith. The storms may rage around us, but we will always stand in the victory of Christ. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Embrace Pure Joy
================
*Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds.* – James 1:2, NIV

What is pure joy for you? Is it a day at the beach? Is it breakfast in bed? Is it winning the lottery?

The Apostle James starts his letter with a really strange statement. You would expect him to tell his readers to be joyful when everything is going well because the Lord is blessing them. Not at all; instead he tells us to consider it pure joy when we face trouble and difficulty.

James says that “whenever” you are facing trials—not some of the trials, but all of them—you should could it not as a little bit of joy, but 100%, unadulterated, full-bottle joy!

And the word “joy” in the Bible doesn’t mean a “grin-and-bear-it” kind of pious tolerance. It really does mean your “cup-runneth-over,” “jump-up-and-down,” “can’t-hide-it” kind of joy.

That’s a joy reflects the reality that we live in as citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven—the reality that all evil has been overcome, even death itself; the reality that we are not only accepted by God, but are his treasured children, forgiven and cherished. And whatever happens, that always remains true.

Embrace pure joy. Choose today to breathe the pure, sweet air of heaven, instead of the pollution that clouds the glory Christ has for us. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Smashing Good News!
===================
*The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.* - Romans 16:20, NIV

This short verse raises some questions. How can Satan be crushed under our feet? Surely, like in other passage in the New Testament, shouldn’t Satan should be crushed under Jesus’ feet? And how can the God of peace do smashing and crushing?

In a quarter of all the times that the Greek word translated as “crushed” in the New Testament, it refers to how demonic spirits crushed people and shattered their lives, taking away their peace. However, Isaiah 53:5 tells us that Jesus was crushed to bring us peace.

The most important thing is to have peace with God. You can have peace in the world, but you will never ever have peace with the world until Satan is crushed. To bring ultimate peace, God must finally crush Satan out of existence, and he will do it under the beautiful feet of those that proclaim the gospel (Romans 10:15; Isaiah 53:5).

To crush Satan under your feet, share the Gospel. When you do that, through the power of Christ, you are coming closer to the day when God will finally crush Satan forever.

How we should look forward to that day! Peace with God now, and peace everlasting to come. That really is smashing good news! – Eliezer Gonzalez

No More Hatred!
===============
*There is no greater love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.* - John 15:13, NLT

There is a power that is stronger than hatred. **It is the power of forgiveness**.

During WWII, Scottish soldiers were forced by their Japanese captors to labor on a jungle railroad. Under the brutality of the Japanese, the men degenerated to barbarous behavior. One afternoon, a shovel went missing.

The officer got his gun and threatened to kill them all on the spot unless the missing shovel was produced. Finally, one man stepped forward. The officer picked up another shovel, and beat the man to death.

When it was over, it was discovered at the second tool check that the shovel wasn’t missing after all.

The word spread like wildfire through the whole camp. An innocent man had been willing to die to save the others! The incident had a profound effect.

The men began to treat each other like brothers. When the victorious Allies swept in, the survivors, human skeletons, lined up in front of their captors, and instead of attacking their captors, insisted:

    "No more hatred. No more killing. Now what we need is forgiveness."

Sacrificial love has transforming power. It is the very power of Christ, given to us through his Spirit. We don’t need more hatred. We need to learn what it is to walk as God’s forgiven children, and never look back again. – Eliezer Gonzalez (Story told by Dale Ratzlaff, taken from Ernest Gordon’s Miracle on the River Kwai.)

Jump For Joy!
=============
*Be truly glad. There is wonderful joy ahead.* - 1 Peter 1:6, NLT

The actual Greek word that Peter uses, that is translated here as truly glad, and as in the KJV, literally means “jump for joy.”
 
The Christian can jump for joy even though he or she may have grief in all kinds of trials (v6a). What’s the reason for all this jumping around? This jump-for-joy gladness is because we have been born again (v3), and so we now live in breathless expectation (v3), because we have a priceless and incorruptible inheritance (v4). And even if we suffer now, nothing can touch us unless God permits it (v5).
 
There are too many mopey Christians who seem to live in perpetual gloom. Perhaps they have not yet got the message that Christ came so that we may have “life to the full” (John 10:10). The happiness promised to believers is not simply a vague hope in the future, but the unshakeable reality of present joy.
 
This is deep, genuine happiness that we can enjoy now. Yes, there most certainly is “wonderful joy ahead.” That doesn’t mean there isn’t joy now. Think about it. It just means that however good it may be now, it’s only going to get better!
 
Excuse me. I have to stand up. I have to jump for joy! – Eliezer Gonzalez

Approach God Based on His Mercy
===============================
*Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions.* - Psalm 51:1, NIV
 
Psalm 26 is very different to the Psalm quoted above. It is a Psalm of David’s youth, written before he understood the depths of his weakness, and the evil of which his heart was capable.
 
David claims in Psalm 26 to have led a blameless life, to have never faltered, and to have never even sat down with evil-doers. He claims that his hands are innocent – all unlike the wicked, who are scheming and bloodthirsty. David asks God to save him because of his personal blamelessness. David is so confident in his superior moral position in relation to sinners, that he asks God to try his heart.

God did try David’s heart. And David was found wanting. David was horrified to discover later in life that he was fully capable of adultery and the vilest murder – in short, that he himself – to borrow the apostle’s term – was the “Chief of Sinners.” This is when he penned a very different Psalm.

We must learn, like David, to pray the prayer that the older and wiser David later prayed in Psalm 51. How different is this plea! Like David, we should plead with God for mercy, not based on our blameless life, but according to God’s unfailing love and compassion. This is the only basis of salvation and acceptance with God. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Age is No Barrier ...
=====================
... **to Bearing Fruit in the Kingdom**

Even in old age they will still produce fruit; they will remain vital and green (Psalm 92:14, NLT).

There are some people who reach an age at which they don’t produce fruit, at which they are “grey and gloomy” rather than “green,” when “complaining” would be a better description for them than “vital.”

At some time in our lives, we will all have to slow down. But slowing down doesn’t mean turning off. We all have a reason to be optimistic – a great reason – especially when you read the promise above.

I have noticed that as people age, they become clearer and clearer images of either the best or the worst of their younger selves. Some people become angrier and more bitter as they age, while others become gentler and kinder versions of themselves. And I think we have a choice in this today, right now and on an ongoing basis. By beholding we become changed (2 Corinthians 3:18). We can choose to fix our eyes on Jesus.

I want to do that too. I want to produce fruit for as long as God will allow me upon this earth. I want to be vital for the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and not for the things of this world. We can always be green and growing in Christ, no matter how old we are. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Be Part of ...
==============
... **Changing the World**

*Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.* - Matthew 6:10, NIV

Charles Colson, of Prison Fellowship, says that “to speak of [William] Wilberforce is to speak of biblical worldview in action.” He (Wilberforce) almost single-handedly put a stop to the vile British slave trade.

What many people don’t know are the other contributions that Wilberforce made to society. He founded the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the British and Foreign Bible Society; he was instrumental in prison reform, and either founded or was a leader in sixty charities.

I wonder what our society would be like if we still legally allowed slavery, and cruelty to animals, if we were without prison reform, without freedom of speech and the notion of universal human rights. Yes, those last two come straight out of Christianity as well. Without Christianity, we would not have the society and the freedoms we have in the West at all.  Charles Colson says:

    *I believe that as we come to understand the depth of our own Christian worldview, it forces us not into a life merely of contemplation, but to one of action. We cannot know God more without being moved to love others more—and to care passionately about justice, mercy, and truth. Jesus Christ was a man of action, and so must we be.*

The citizens of the Kingdom will always advance the Kingdom. – Eliezer Gonzalez

In the Kingdom ...
==================
... **We Speak to The Bones**

*“Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, ‘O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord!  Thus says the Lord God to these bones: “Surely I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.”* -  Ezekiel 37:4–5, NKJV

One of the Bible’s most striking images, one that has stayed in my head since childhood, is the valley of the bones. In Ezekiel 37, the prophet records his vision of a valley where a battle had happened long ago, and the bones of the dead were scattered across the valley floor.
 
God tells Ezekiel to speak to the bones. What a stupidly hopeless task that must have seemed! Speak to the bones? Surely the most useless sermon ever!
 
But as Ezekiel obeyed God, the bones reassembled themselves into people who came back to life. Before Ezekiel now stood a vast army of living men.
 
You and I have been given a task that is seemingly hopeless: to go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation (Mark 16:15). Yet everywhere we look is spiritual death; everywhere there seems to be a profound rejection of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
 
God is calling you to share and support the Gospel of the Kingdom of life with every word you speak, every activity you undertake, and using all means at your disposal.
 
Are you happy to sit by yourself in a valley of dry bones? No? Well, what are you waiting for? Start speaking to those bones! – Eliezer Gonzalez

There’s Always Bread ...
========================
... **in the House of Bread**

*Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.* - Matthew 4:4, NIV

In the story of Ruth, she and Naomi, her mother-in-law, travel from Moab to Bethlehem because they have heard that there is food in Bethlehem (1:6). That shouldn’t be so strange, because the name “Bethlehem” means literally, the “House of Bread.” The whole story of Ruth, points us powerfully toward the coming, bread-providing Messiah, who would feed His people, the One who would be literally be born in Bethlehem.

When His disciples came back from buying food in the Samaritan village, they found Jesus sharing the Good News with a despised Samaritan woman. He said to them, “I am fed by doing the will of the one who sent me and by completing his work” (John 4:34). Jesus was trying to teach the disciples that the Bread of Life that came from Bethlehem was not only for Bethlehem, but that it was to feed the whole world, even a woman of Samaria.

Can you and I be fed in this way too? Jesus declared, “I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever, and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh” (John 6:51).

Because of Calvary, none need ever go hungry again. There’s always bread in Bethlehem. – Eliezer Gonzalez

No Condemnation
===============

*For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.* - John 3:17, NIV

The most famous verse in all the Bible, and rightly so, is John 3:16:

    *For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.*

This verse is so good, that we often miss what follows.

I was reading the next verse (v.17) the other day when something hit me across the head like a plank of wood! Notice what it says: that God didn’t send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world.

And if God didn’t send Jesus into the world to condemn, then... don’t condemn!
It’s interesting that the only sins that Jesus really ever called out were those of the smug and self-satisfied. It’s true that we must stand up against sin. But too often we strain at a gnat and swallow a camel (Matthew 23:24). We’re more concerned about the sawdust in our brother’s eye then the plank of timber in our own (Matthew 7:3).

The sin we must stand up against the most is usually our own.

Jesus spoke the words of John 3:17 to Nicodemus. Nicodemus was good at condemning. I’ve had too much of Nicodemus in me in my past, and not enough of Jesus. What about you? – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Reality of God
******************


God Tells Us The Truth ...
==========================
... **About Our World**

*The earth is the LORD's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it* – Psalm 24:1
 
The reality of the world is itself evidence for the existence of God. The universe’s fundamental constants fall within a narrow range that is compatible with life. Today there are 38 recognised cosmic constants. Of these, the most sensitive is the space energy density (the self-stretching property of the universe). Its value cannot vary by more than one part in 10,120, or else life would be impossible.
 
However, it's not just the mathematics of the universe or the world that points us to God.
 
People look at the suffering and evil in the world and see it as evidence that there is no God. Instead, I see it as evidence for God, because God tells us that we live in a world of suffering and evil. I believe in God because this world is exactly what I would expect it to be if there were a God who tells us the truth.
 
I see a world that is broken and lost in sin; but even so, Christ loves it, and he passionately claims it for himself by virtue of his blood. In the words of Abraham Kuyper,
 
There is not one square inch in the whole domain of human existence over which Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all, does not exclaim, “It’s Mine!” – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Language of the Stars
=========================
*The heavens are telling the glory of God; they are a marvelous display of his craftsmanship. Day and night they keep on telling about God. Without a sound or word, silent in the skies, their message reaches out to all the world* - Psalm 19:1–3, TLB

Once a year, our family goes camping by the beach in northern NSW, Australia. This is when I am happiest, since it combines two of my great loves: the sea and the sky.
 
My most intimate prayer times with God are typically when walking along the beach, or under the stars. There is something about being free of four walls and a ceiling that liberates my soul beyond myself.
 
When I see the power of the ocean waves against the enormity of the blue horizon, or when I walk under the immensity of the stars of the Milky Way, strewn like countless candles across the sky, my thoughts cannot help but go beyond myself, and turn to God. It is almost as if God himself speaks, without words, directly to my soul.
 
That’s what David wrote about in Psalm 19. He tells us that the heavens have their own language that continually tells us about God. He also tells us that their message reaches the whole world.
 
All of us need to enlarge our spirits beyond ourselves, to reach out to heaven, to breathe in the language of our Creator God. I’ve found that difficult to do within four walls. But he's still there; God never stops speaking. Are we listening? – Eliezer Gonzalez

To Know Him Is To Love Him
==========================
*The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being.* - Hebrews 1:3
 
When Amy Winehouse covered the song, “To Know Him is to Love Him,” she might not have known that this title is more true of God than of anyone else. If what Jesus reveals about God is true, then the only reason that anyone would have for not loving him is because they’ve never known him.
 
Our ideas about God come from many sources, but just how accurate are they? Is God some kind of moral monster? Or is he like a strict disciplinarian father? Or does he just intervene in this world from time to time and from far away by pressing a few keys on his heavenly computer?
 
The Bible tells us that Jesus came to show us what God is like. It tells us about a God who became one of us because he loves us recklessly and at any cost. That’s what the story of the Cross is all about.
 
If you want to know what God is like, look at Jesus. Jesus is a living revelation of God that you cannot get from any philosophy, teaching, or book. Christ’s revelation of the goodness of God will change how you see yourself, the world, and everyone you share it with. – Eliezer Gonzalez

You Can Trust ...
=================
... **Who’s On The Throne**

*I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders.* - Revelation 5:6, NIV

We’ve all wondered at some point why life hardly ever works out the way we expect. Why the best-laid plans too often fail?

God showed the prophet Ezekiel a vision of enormous wheels within wheels turning in every direction, and above them, the throne of God (Ezekiel 1). The great mystery of this vision was, “Who is it that sits upon the throne?”

In the Book of Revelation the prophet John saw a similar scene. But in this vision, the identity of the one who sits on the throne is revealed. For right in the middle of the throne is the Lamb who was slain.

The One who is on the throne is not some distant deity; He is the Man of Sorrows, the Lamb of Calvary – the One who understands. The constant movement of the wheels within wheels tells you that the Lamb of Calvary is quick to be with you when you need Him. Nothing can happen without His permission. And wherever those wheels go in your life, you can trust the One who’s on the throne, for on the throne is Love Himself. He is the Lamb who was slain for you.

What do you do when you can’t understand? You keep on trusting. What do you do when you’ve seen the Lamb? You keep on following. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Eternity is God’s Gift to You
=============================
*I am the Alpha and the Omega, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.* - Revelation 1:8

In spite of what Dr. Who, the Time Lord from the BBC television series, might tell you, we haven’t mastered time yet. Time goes by at the same speed for all of us. It’s what we do with it that counts.
 
There is only one Time Lord, and that’s our God and Saviour, Jesus Christ. While you’re thinking about eternity, I want to do a thought experiment with you based on an illustration told by Des Ford.
 
I’ve seen the Andes in South America, and they’re awesome. But the Himalayas are even bigger still! So now think of a bird that, once every million years, comes and takes away a grain of soil from the Himalayas. How long will it take that bird to get rid of the Himalayas? That length of time is just the start of eternity!
 
What God offers us is eternity. And if God wants to give us something as infinite as eternity, how could we finite humans ever earn it? It has to be free.
 
Our God tells us that He loves us with an everlasting love (Jeremiah 31:3), a love that’s stronger than death (Song of Solomon 8:6), and that fills eternity. Because of what Jesus did at the Cross, eternity is there for the taking. It’s what you do with it that counts. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus Gives You Real Life
=========================
*Everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die.* - John 11:26, NASB

Look at how full of life children are! Although age, sickness, and the eventual troubles of life wear us down, most people at the end of their days hold on, wanting another day, another hour, even another minute. It’s innate in us to want to live, and not to die.
 
Although we all inevitably die, that's not the reason we come into the world. We come into the world to live.
 
But Jesus is different, because Jesus actually came to die (John 3:16). Jesus came to die so that by delivering you from death, you could live – truly live – both here in this life (John 10:10) and in eternity. Just as little kids enjoy life, Jesus has given us eternity to enjoy.
 
Jesus died so you might never die (John 11:25). When you believe in him, though you may die an earthly death, Jesus counts it merely as a sleep (John 11:11,14), and as the blink of an eye (1 Corinthians 15:52). You are always safe in Christ and you will rise again!
 
When you accept Christ’s gift of life, you have eternity in which to be the person whom you were always meant to be, and to enjoy the best of life forever. That’s God’s ultimate purpose for you. – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Cross Makes the Bitter Sweet
================================
*And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma.* – Ephesians 5:2, NKJV

After the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea, the Children of Israel travelled through the desert for three days without finding any water. Then suddenly, in the distance, they saw what looked like an oasis!
 
Imagine their disappointment, when they bent down to drink, to find that the water was bitter and undrinkable! They called the place “Marah,” which means “bitter” (Exodus 15:23).
 
God showed Moses a piece of wood, and when Moses threw it into the water, the water became sweet and refreshing (v.25).
 
Because we live in this world, there’s always some bitter water just around the corner. But piece of wood represented Christ. He is the One who threw Himself into the bitterness of this world, so that everything that He touches turns sweet. He is the One who was offered the bitter gall upon the Cross. He is the one who drank the bitter cup of the wrath of God on behalf of the entire world, so that all who accept Him may drink the sweetest wine of His love.
 
That piece of wood represents the Cross of Calvary. It is the Cross of Christ by which the transforming grace of heaven has touched this earth, bringing a flood of sweet living water for all who believe. – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Joy Is In the Walk
======================
*My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.* - John 10:27, NKJV

As Christians, we seem to be always waiting for God to do something. We often think that the joy is in the answered prayer, but what if the joy is also actually in the praying itself?
 
I was sitting at an airport waiting for my flight recently, when I had this feeling for a moment that someone was watching me. It’s odd when that happens, isn’t it? And sure enough, a few moments later, a friend who also happened to be in the airport came up to me and said, “Hi!”
 
Maybe Jesus felt something similar as he was walking along one day, he realised that there were two men following him. So he turned around and said to them,

    *“What do you want?”
    They said to him, “Teacher, where are you staying?”
    He replied, “Come, and you will see.”* – John 1:37–39
 
Jesus doesn’t invite them to a destination, rather, he invites them on a journey. He just says, “Come.” It’s natural for us to want to know the destination. Too often we think that happiness is at the end of the road somewhere.
 
But Jesus knows that the joy is in the walk, and if you’re walking with Jesus, you’re already there. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Your Heavenly Father Sees ...
=============================
... **You From Afar**

*While he was still a long way off, his father saw him coming. Filled with love and compassion, he ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him.* - Luke 15:20, NLT

While swimming at a surf beach, I became caught in a current that dragged me towards some jagged rocks. I didn’t fully understand the danger that I was in, but before I knew it, a lifeguard appeared beside me, and he took me back to safety. I had been a long way out from the shore, so he must have seen me through his binoculars.
 
In the Bible there’s a story of a runaway son. He thought he’d have a better life if he left home, but one day he finally realised what his father’s love meant. And so he started his long journey home.
 
The boy’s father had never given up on him, and the story says that even while the boy was a long way off, his dad saw him from far away, and ran out along the road, to throw his arms around him and welcome him home.
 
This tells us that God sees us. No matter how far you think you are from God, he sees you, and he sees you with love in his eyes. Your Heavenly Father waits for you, with a loving welcome, and acceptance and joy.
 
We have a Father who sees us from afar, and saves us from our foolishness. – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Father Never Forsakes His Children
======================================

*My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?* - Matthew 27:46

Have you ever felt forsaken by God? I have. We’re all human. But one of the hardest lessons we must learn is not to trust our own feelings. Jesus felt forsaken by God while on the cross as well.

But how could the Father who never forsakes his children, abandon his Holy Son?

Jesus said that the Father did not leave him alone (John 8:29). Paul says explicitly that at the Cross,

    *“God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself.”* 2 Corinthians 5:19

Read Psalm 22, from which Jesus quotes in his cry of abandonment. Read the context. You will find that this psalm is actually an explicit affirmation of God’s presence, in spite of all appearances to the contrary (v.24).
 
At the end, Jesus speaks words of faith to his Father, in full confidence of his loving presence,

    *“Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.”* Luke 23:46

He knew that the Father had not forsaken him, in spite of his suffering and anguish of mind.

The lesson of the Cross is that the Father never forsakes his children, even in their darkest moments. No matter what you might be going through, if you can still call him “Father,” then remember that he forever calls you his precious child. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus Reigns!
=============

*The Lord says to my lord: “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.” The Lord will extend your mighty scepter from Zion, saying, “Rule in the midst of your enemies!”* - Psalm 110:1–2, NIV

The passage from the Old Testament that is most often cited in the New is Psalm 110.  The apostolic church saw this Psalm as referring to the risen, ascended Messiah, and the Kingdom that he had firmly established in this world at the Cross. They understood that they were living in the time of the ‘until’—the time during which Christ is sitting at the right hand of the Father, waiting until the time his Kingdom physically overthrows all the kingdoms of this world.

Despite worldly appearances, Christ is sitting at the right hand of power. The Kingdom of God is already established on this earth, although not yet manifested in its fullness. Christ still rules “in the midst of his enemies” (Psalm 110:2). We look forward to the time soon when Christ’s enemies will all be completely overthrown.

Until that time, we are living in the ‘until’. We keep our eyes on Jesus who has gone before us, who has won the victory on our behalf, and who rules over all. That reality is transformative for how we see ourselves, for our relationships, and how we relate to the world around us.

We announce Christ’s kingdom wherever we go, while we wait until the time when all of Christ’s enemies will finally be under his feet. – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Unbeliever and the Acorn
============================

*I want to know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him from the dead.* - Philippians 3:10, NLT

In Italy is the centuries-old grave of an unbeliever. Before he died, he ordered a huge stone slab for his grave to prevent him from being raised from the dead if there was, after all, a resurrection. The sign announced: “I do not want to be raised from the dead. I don’t believe in it.”

A hundred years later an acorn had pushed through the slab and grown into a towering oak tree. A visiting minister asking himself, “If an acorn, which has power of biological life in it, can split a slab like that, what can the acorn of God’s resurrection power do in a person’s life?”

This story, told by Tim Keller, highlights a powerful truth. When you know Christ you will experience his mighty resurrection power. The apostle Paul talks specifically about the resurrection of the dead at the last day, but also about how that certainty changes our present reality. When, by faith, we accept Christ’s death and resurrection on our behalf, this empowers us to press on towards the heavenly prize (Philippians 3:14).

Today, the mighty resurrection power of Christ is shed abroad to all who believe; to all who are righteous through faith in him. There is nothing that can keep a Christian down, not now, or certainly not on the day of resurrection! – Eliezer Gonzalez

You Can’t Bribe God
===================

*Is anyone thirsty? Come and drink — even if you have no money! Come, take your choice of wine and milk — it’s all free!* - Isaiah 55:1, TLB

The story of Simon the Sorcerer in Acts 8 illustrates how Christianity was misinterpreted even in the times of the earliest church. Simon was a magician in Samaria. He liked to portray himself as having great wonder working powers. So he offered the apostles money so that he could receive the power of the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:18–19).
 
Simon tried to bribe God. He thought that if he gave God his money, that God would give him his blessing. He was as mistaken as you can get.
 
Too many people relate to our religious experience as if it were some kind of reciprocal business transaction with God. “If I am good, then God will save me.” “If I follow the rules then God will love me.” “If I am faithful then God will heal me.”
 
But God’s blessing is his own free gift to us. We shouldn’t cheapen the blood of Christ by trying to bribe God with the paltry, miserable things that we offer up to him.
 
You can’t bribe God (Acts 8:20). All religion that tries to offer God something in exchange for his favour is false religion. The only thing that can make us acceptable before God is the atoning blood of Christ that was shed for us at Calvary. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Costly Grace
============

*For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.* - John 3:16, NIV

    **Costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again and again, the gift which must be asked for, the door at which a man must knock. Such grace is costly because it calls us to follow, and it is grace because it calls us to follow Jesus Christ. It is costly because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life. It is costly because it condemns sin, and grace because it justifies the sinner. Above all, it is costly because it cost God the life of his Son: ‘Ye were bought at a price’, and what has cost God much cannot be cheap for us. Above all, it is grace because God did not reckon his Son too dear a price to pay for our life, but delivered him up for us. Costly grace is the Incarnation of God.** – Dietrich Bonhoffer

There is another gospel: the gospel of cheap grace. So, what is the gospel of cheap grace? It is any gospel that says that your salvation is so easy that you could do something to contribute towards it. I believe in costly grace. Cheap grace is not enough.

The only one that can save me is the grace that cost God everything and is free to me. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus is the True Temple
========================

*I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go to the house of the Lord.”* - Psalm 122:1; NASB

Sometimes, the building in which Christians meet is called their “church,” the “house of the Lord,” the “sanctuary,” or even the “temple.” The Old Testament is full of expressions that point to how good it is to be in the “house of the Lord.” However, this expression only ever refers to the Jewish temple in the city of Jerusalem. This, and everything associated with it, are called “shadows of things to come” (Colossians 2:17.)

One of the very first things that Jesus did in his earthly ministry was to stand right in the middle of the Jewish temple and announce that he himself was the true temple (John 2). The temple only ever pointed to him. Every temple concept in the Bible, whether on earth or in heaven, always ultimately points to Jesus and his ministry.
 
Jesus announces that salvation, safety, and blessings are found only in him, in whom the fullness of the glory of God dwells (Colossians 1:19). Jesus is himself now the true “house of the Lord,” and through Jesus, his people can be God’s house as well (1 Corinthians 3:16).
 
The Bible tells us that one day soon there will be no more temple – not in heaven, and certainly not on earth – because the Lamb of God is revealed as the True Temple. (Revelation 21:22). – Eliezer Gonzalez

God’s Church is Unlimited
=========================

*For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.* - Ephesians 3:14–15, NIV

As Neil Armstrong gazed at the earth from space, he is reported to have reflected that, “[i]t suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn’t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.”
 
Perhaps the perspective that we often have about God’s church is too small, because we are limited in our natural perception of space and time. Perhaps God wants us to see the bigger picture. Wherever it is that you gather with God’s people, it is wonderful to realise that God’s church is unlimited.
 
God’s church is unlimited because it extends throughout heaven and earth, and throughout the universe. (Colossians 1:20; Hebrews 12:22–23). Its extent is beyond our comprehension.
 
God’s church is unlimited because it cannot be limited to any one denomination. The different Christian communities have been a great blessing to the church of God in different ways, however none of them can ever claim to encompass God’s church within themselves (Acts 2:21; Acts 13:39).
 
God’s church is unlimited because it does what Jesus Christ did when he walked on earth, and that is to welcome sinners (Luke 15:2).
 
There’s nothing small about God’s church. So, let’s live big for Jesus! – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus Is Right Here With You
============================

*He asked her, “Woman, why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?” Thinking he was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.” Jesus said to her, “Mary.”* – John 20:15-16

What is the most important question in the world? It is this one: “Who are you looking for?” Everyone is looking for someone.
 
You see, most of us think that we are looking for things, because if we find those things then they will make us happy. They won’t. Jesus goes to the heart of the matter. God knows that the right answers can only be found when we ask the right questions. God knows that you and I – all of humanity, is looking for someone, not something. And that someone is Jesus himself.
 
At the tomb, Mary was distraught because she didn’t know where Jesus was. She couldn’t have been more wrong, because the one she was looking for was standing right behind her all the time. She simply didn’t recognise him. She was blinded by her tears.
 
Too often in our times of trouble, we wonder where Jesus is. We plead with God, “Where are you, Jesus? You promised to be with me always! Where are you now, when I need you?” And blinded, like Mary, by our tears, we fail to recognise that Jesus was with us all along.
               
The rebuke of the Lord is the gentlest and most beautiful that could ever be imagined. Jesus just says your name with a love that has borne a thousand wounds. – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Lord Has Provided
=====================

*“The fire and wood are here,” Isaac said, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” Abraham answered, “God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.”* - Genesis 22:7–8, NIV

The lesson that Abraham learned when God called him to sacrifice his son was that God will provide. For a sacrifice, three things were required. Wood, a fire, and a lamb. All of these things were usually carried with them. Most importantly, there could not be a sacrifice without a lamb.
 
On his journey with his father Abraham, Isaac wondered where the lamb was. After God had indeed provided a lamb for the sacrifice, the faithfulness of God so impressed Abraham, that he called the place, Jehovah-jireh, which means, “The Lord Will Provide” (v.14).
 
Abraham’s journey to the place where God called him to sacrifice his son is a metaphor of the history of the God’s faithful men and women since the fall. The journey started in sadness and confusion, but it continued in faith that God would provide a way out – a sacrifice.
 
The great theme of the Old Testament is the promise that “The Lord Will Provide,” and the victorious cry of the New Testament is “The Lord Has Provided!” (Romans 8:32).
 
You and I are not living in a time of shadowy, unrealised hopes, but in the time of glorious fulfilment because of the Cross and resurrection of Christ. Truly, the Lord has provided! We have not been left alone in confusion and helplessness (Psalm 23). – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Kingdom ...
===============
... **of the Born Again**

*Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.* - John 3:3, NIV

When the army of the Arameans surrounded Samaria, the prophet Elisha’s servant was terrified. The prophet said to him,
 
    *"Don’t be afraid ... Those who are with us are more than those who are with them."* 2 Kings 6:16

Then Elisha prayed for his servant, so that the Lord would open his eyes, and this is what happened:

    *The Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.* v.17

We are surrounded and immersed in a spiritual world that exists alongside the physical realm which we inhabit. Like Elisha’s servant, if we could only see the spiritual realities, we would understand why things are as they are.
 
There are some people who profoundly understand what the kingdom of God is about, and more than that, they experience it as the bedrock reality of their lives. Then there are those who don’t understand, who laugh at it, and at those who believe in it. Why is there such a difference between these two groups of people?
 
Jesus’ words give us the answer. The Kingdom of God can only be seen, and experienced, by those who have been born again. – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Kingdom of God ...
======================
... **is For Real**

*Faith is the reality of what we hope for, the proof of what we don’t see.* - Hebrews 11:1, CEB

The worldview of many people can be defined as “scientific materialism,” which says that physical reality, such as can be accessed by the natural sciences, is all that exists. These people reject out of hand such things as life after death, the Kingdom of Heaven, and even God himself.
 
However, the Bible teaches us a very different way of looking at reality. 1 Corinthians 15 has a fascinating discussion about physical and spiritual realities. It tells us that the natural (or the physical) points us to the spiritual, and the spiritual is far greater than the natural as the sun is to the moon in its light. To stop only at the physical is to miss out on the greater part of existence and reality.
 
That’s why in Hebrews 11:1 it tells us that “faith” isn’t some fantasy. Faith is like another of the physical senses, except that it isn’t physical. To exercise faith is a real experience. It allows us to take hold of the unseen world of the spiritual.
 
After his resurrection, Jesus said to Thomas,
 
    *“Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”* John 20:29
 
There is a blessing for those who experience reality through the eyes of faith. To do that is to see God. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Beauty Points to God
====================

*He has made everything beautiful in its time.* - Ecclesiastes 3:11. NIV

I love sunsets, especially when they occur over the water.
 
Beauty itself is, in fact, a great mystery. Why is it that our world overflows with beauty, rather than random chaos? Why is it that the colours of sunset are so perfectly colour-coordinated? Surely that speaks of design?
 
Why is it that we seek out beautiful sights and things, not for any other purpose, but to for the sake of beauty itself? Doesn’t that infer that we are naturally drawn to something beyond us, something transcendent that doesn’t respond to the immediate and practical needs of survival?
 
The other amazing thing about beauty is that we don’t tend to disagree very much about what is beautiful. There’s a universal dimension to beauty. In spite of a few cultural differences, we tend to be in general agreement about what is beautiful.
 
Why is this so? To my mind, the answer lies in the existence of an absolute Being over and above us all, who values beauty for its own sake, and has created us to value it also. That kind of God – one who values love, goodness, and beauty – is One that I can unreservedly worship.
 
My God is a God who has destined me for beauty. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Made for You
============

*He who fashioned and made the earth, he founded it; he did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited.* - Isaiah 45:18, NIV

The Bible tells us that planet earth was made specifically for humanity. If that is true, then what would we expect to find with regard to this planet?
 
    * We would expect to find the right ingredients to sustain life forms that can coexist with human beings, such as liquid water, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and a chemical building block like carbon.
    
    * We would expect to find temperatures within a narrow range to sustain human beings (and other things such as liquid water).
    
    * We would expect to find a large moon positioned to ensure climate stability.
    
    * We would expect to find just the right star that would remain fairly stable.
    
    * We would expect to find a planetary core that would help generate the planet’s protective electromagnetic field, to protect us from deadly solar radiation.
    
    * We would expect to find the right planetary neighbours, such as Jupiter, which shields the earth from constant stellar bombardment.
 
All of these things work together, with extreme precision, to ensure a safe home for humanity. Scientists call this the “Goldilocks Principle,” because of all the apparent coincidences that are involved in ensuring that the earth is “just right” for us. However, there are no coincidences with God, only the providence of his grace. God knew what he was doing when he created this planet and put us in it. 

God still knows what he’s doing today, and if you will allow him, he’ll work out your life to the fulfilment of a wonderful destiny that’s even more than “just right.” – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Evidence of Experience
==========================

*I heard about you from others; now I have seen you with my own eyes.* - Job 42:5, CEV

How is it that people know that you exist? Because they experience you. They experience your presence, activity, and impact on their lives. It’s the same with God.
 
Throughout the Bible, God is never trying to give logical evidences for his existence. The Bible was never meant to be an apologetics textbook. The “proofs” are there for the philosophers and debaters to play with. But you don’t have to prove logically that you exist to someone who experiences your presence, do you? That’s why God is constantly inviting people to experience him in their lives.
 
In the Bible’s book of Job, the story comes to a climax as Job expresses to God his amazement at how wonderful it is to know God for himself, rather than all the things that others had said about him. In my own life, it has been a slow, sometimes dramatic, and even sometimes painful journey to know who God is for myself, through an ever-deeper personal relationship. I thought I knew who God was, because I had heard sermons about him and read about him in books – even in the Bible.
 
But I’ve learnt that it’s not good enough to know about God. It is only good enough to know God, for yourself, and with nothing in between. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Creating God in Our Own Image
=============================

*They traded the truth about God for a lie. So they worshiped and served the things God created instead of the Creator himself.* - Romans1:26, NLT

In many ways, people have created God in their own image: narrow-minded people serve a narrow-minded God, resentful people serve a resentful God, small people serve a small God, and legalists serve a legalistic God.

Others serve a great big God whose forgiveness is unconditional, whose mercy is boundless, whose companionship is personal, and whose currency is love. Why do different people see God so differently?

Human beings have been trying to create God in their own image from the beginning. We want a God who is just like us – a God whom we can control. Because what we create, we can control. But you can’t create, and you definitely can’t control God. Some people like the idea of god, more than they like God himself, because an idea is easier to control than the real thing.

God showed us how unexpectedly and concretely he acts, in sending Jesus Christ to us to show us what God is actually like. This revelation was not abstract or intellectual in nature, but totally objective: God lived among us for decades in the flesh.

God desperately wants us to know Him, because to know him means salvation. Don’t let your knowledge of what God is like be defined by your upbringing, culture, or even your church. You can know God by knowing Jesus. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus is the Son of Man
=======================

*The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.* - Mark 10:45, NIV

The name that Jesus used most often for himself, the name by which he preferred to be known, was a name that intimately and forever connected him with humanity – “Son of Man.” Not “Son of God”, but “Son of Man.”

The name “Son of Man” expresses one of the closest human bonds that can exist, the son-father relationship. In Jesus’ culture, the son always put the father first; the son honoured the father and did what the father could not do for himself. Even more than this, Jesus specifies that this servant-relationship to humanity is expressed in his redemptive self-sacrifice for all. He says that,

    *"...the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many..."* Mark 10:45

Jesus came to this earth to be by your side – to be much more than just your best friend. He came to be related to you by blood – a blood-relationship that is even closer than anything you may have understood before, because it was forged by the sacrifice of flawless love and not by flawed genetics.

In whatever may be your need right now, He will stand there beside you. He will never leave you nor forsake you. – Eliezer Gonzalez

He Loved Them to The End
========================

*Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.* – John 13:1, NKJV
 
This text describes the attitude of Jesus just before the Last Supper. The thought of what he was about to do, and the weight of the awesomeness of the burden that he would carry almost overwhelmed him.

This text doesn’t mean that he loved his own until the end of his life. That’s not what the Greek means at all. The Common English Bible translates it as:

    *Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them fully.*

What the text means is that Jesus loved them to the uttermost. This is extreme love. This is even more than a love that goes beyond what we can understand or beyond what we have experienced. This is love taken to an unending extreme, in a way that only the divine heart of bottomless love can do. Jesus loves us to the end.

The ones whom he loves are “His own who were in the world.” He was talking about his disciples, with whom he was about to eat the Last Supper. He was about to be betrayed, denied, and abandoned by them. Yet still he loved them to the end.

He was talking about you and me, by whom he has been betrayed, denied, and abandoned. Yet he loves us to the end. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Love That Makes No Sense
========================

*Consider the kind of extravagant love the Father has lavished on us—He calls us children of God!* - 1 John 3:1, Voice

While most prophecies begin with an explicit command for the prophet to prophesy, the book of Hosea begins with God’s instructions for him to get married (Hosea 3:1).

This is no ordinary marriage. God shockingly commands Hosea, a respectable young man, to propose to a prostitute.

Hosea’s marriage became a living sermon: a reflection of the sad relationship between God and Israel. What Hosea did for Gomer, God did for Israel; what Gomer did to Hosea, Israel did to God.

Humanly speaking, Hosea’s love for Gomer did not make any sense. People must have thought, “What is wrong with Hosea? Why doesn’t he divorce her and get himself a decent wife?” But, that was the very point of the message. God’s love for sinners is unexplainable apart from his free and sovereign grace.

The message of Hosea transcends his time and circumstance to ours. We too have turned to strange gods of money, politics, traditions, fame and wealth. At the Cross, God enters into a marriage covenant with us, having saved us while we were still sinners (Romans 5:8).

As it was in the marriage of Hosea, so is it in the covenant of grace. God continues to love us despite our constant failures. The only proper response to this kind of love is always genuine repentance. – Eliezer Gonzalez

God Invests in You
==================

*Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?* - Jeremiah 32:27, NKJV

Jeremiah 32 describes a time when things were very bleak for God’s people. Their nation was about to be destroyed by the Babylonian empire.

Just then, God comes to Jeremiah with an astonishing business proposition. He says, “I want you to buy your cousin’s field” (v.8.) Who in their right mind would be buying real estate in the current situation! Surely it was worthless! And Jeremiah himself is in prison, with no certainty that he will live!

God is no fool. He’s the greatest investor ever.

But Jeremiah can’t work out the logic behind this. So the Lord speaks to Jeremiah and says,

    *“I am the Lord, the God of all living things! Is anything too hard for me?”* v.27

There will be times when it seems that no one will invest in you; that everyone has written you off. There will be times when it will appear as if you have no future, and that your life is absolutely doomed.

It is then that you need to remember that there is someone who has already invested in you – Jesus Christ at Calvary. He was a prisoner, just like Jeremiah. He was surrounded by his enemies, just like Jeremiah. And Jesus bought the field of your life. And the price that he paid for it was his blood. – Eliezer Gonzalez

You Have a Prodigal Father
==========================

*While he was still a long way off, his father saw him coming. Filled with love and compassion, he ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him.* - Luke 15:20, NLT

Prodigal means extravagant, even to the point of wastefulness.

Most people think that the Parable of the Prodigal Son is about the younger son who was prodigal with his Father’s gifts. But it’s not about him.

Some people think that the parable is about the older son who appears in the second half of the story. It’s not. Yes, the older son was prodigal with his hard work. But it’s not about him. The main character in the parable is the Father.

It’s the father who’s the greatest prodigal, giving half of everything he owns to his younger son in the first place. He didn’t have to do it. He’s prodigal even to the point of wastefulness! Those who heard this story surely shook their heads in disapproval at the father!

It is the Father who is the greatest prodigal, in his love and forgiving mercy towards his wayward child. And then, scandalously, the Father throws the biggest, noisiest party ever, so that the whole neighbourhood would know that there is joy in this home because his son has returned!

Oh yes, this parable has the expansive, unbounded, extravagant love of the Father written all over it. It really is the Parable of the Prodigal Father. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Seeing God For Yourself
=======================
*Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed* - John 20: 29

There’s no greater evidence than the evidence of your own eyes, or so they say. This is what Job affirmed after he had gone through all of his troubles,

    *My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.* - Job 42:5

The entire message of Christianity is bound up on the eyewitness nature of the testimony of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. “We have seen the Lord!” is the catch-cry of the Christian.
 
How can we be Christians if we have not seen the Lord with our own eyes? How can we even believe in God?

Things that are spiritual are just as real as those that are physical (1 Corinthians 15:46). That’s why there’s another kind of sight that the Bible tells us about. The Bible talks about the “eyes of your heart” (Ephesians 1:18). This is the means through which the believer perceives the spiritual world. We also call it faith.
 
Through faith we are assured of the presence of God, of his love, and of his acceptance of us through Jesus Christ. Our faith is never just an intellectual belief, but is grounded in a lived reality.
 
It isn’t good enough to hear about God. We need to hear from God. And his message is in Jesus Christ. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus Prayed For You
====================
*Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.* - Luke 23:34, NKJV

Because I’ve got relatives overseas, some of whom are elderly, I’ve had to say goodbye to them, knowing that I might never see them again. Our final words mean can mean a lot. Sometimes people pray.

It is fitting that Jesus’ final words on the Cross were a prayer. He could have prayed for many things. He could have prayed to be saved from crucifixion, or to be granted a painless death. He could have prayed for a display of glory from the Father to vindicate his name, or for courage for his cowardly disciples. But he prayed for none of these things. He prayed for what his heart most desired: forgiveness for you.

You weren’t there, but because he died for the sins of the world, Jesus wasn’t thinking just of the people who physically crucified him. He was thinking of a lost and broken world.

He wasn’t thinking of himself. He was thinking of you.

He understands how hard it is for us. He understands how often and how far we fall. And most of all Christ wanted you to know that you are forgiven.

It’s only human to doubt God sometimes, and to question whether he even thinks about us. At those times, remember Christ’s words at Calvary. They should banish your doubts forever. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus Prayed For You at Calvary
===============================
*I have prayed for you ... that your faith may not fail.* - Luke 22:32

Each of Christ’s seven last words on the Cross was a prayer on your behalf.
 
    **“Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.”**

This was prayer for forgiveness for a sinful, ignorant world.

    **“Truly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.”**

This was a prayer that spoke of Christ’s saving love for every sinner, no matter the depths to which they may have fallen.

    **“Jesus said to His mother: 'Woman, this is your son.' Then He said to the disciple: 'This is your mother.'”**

This was a prayer for a new humanity, created through His own blood.

    **“My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”**
 
This was a prayer on behalf of all those who have ever felt abandoned by God.
 
    **“I thirst.”**

This was a prayer on behalf of all those who have suffered for the sake of the Kingdom of God.
 
    **“It is finished.”**

This was a prayer that announced a completed atonement for all who believe.
 
    **Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit.”**

This was a prayer of total trust in God.
 
In each of these seven perfect prayers of Christ, you see His heart, and in Christ’s heart there is perfect assurance of salvation for everyone who believes. – Eliezer Gonzalez

God Hears His Children
======================
*When you pray, I will listen.* - Jeremiah 29:12

It seems that the more connected we are with the world, the more disconnected we become from each other. People wander around, lost in a world of noise, and they wonder if anyone listens. We can upgrade our phones but we never seem to be able to upgrade our communication.

Sometimes, we think of God as being distant in that kind of way. But in the Kingdom of God, it works differently. Yes, God hears our prayers, but it gets even better than that! God says,

    *Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear.* - Isaiah 65:24
 
In the Kingdom of God we are connected with Him all the time, so that even before we call Him, He answers, and He knows what we’ve said even before we’ve finished saying it. There’s no communication system on earth that can compare to that! And that should make you feel very safe in the Kingdom of God, whatever dangers that you may face. It’s kind of like God’s own ultra-advanced Kingdom-technology that He makes available to you. You don’t even need a contract. It’s all been paid for by Jesus Christ, so you get it for free.

Jesus has an open-door policy: it’s called prayer. – Eliezer Gonzalez

We Can Believe Even ...
=======================
... **in the Face of Mocking**

*Don’t be afraid; just believe.* - Mark 5:36

When Jesus arrived at Jairus’ house, he said,

    *“What’s all this commotion and crying about? The child isn’t dead. She’s only sleeping.”* Mark 5:39 CEB
 
But the people there...

    *“laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.”* Luke 8:53 CEB

They didn’t just smile quietly to themselves; not at all. The Greek word used for “laugh” here means to “deride.” The King James Version translates this as “they laughed him to scorn.” They openly mocked the apparent stupidity of Christ.

This was just a foretaste of that awful day when the crowd would laugh him to scorn on Calvary’s hill. They thought he was helpless and defeated in the face of death. How wrong they were!
 
But what happens next in Jairus’ house is startling:

    *“He threw them all out.”* Mark 5:40a, CEB

The Greek word translated here as “threw” implies haste, and even force. Jesus didn’t want their laughter and mocking to ruin the wondrously beautiful moment that would come after he said the words,

    *“Young woman, get up.”* Mark 5:41
 
That was when the real party began, as a mother and father received their daughter back to life again.

Don’t allow unbelief to ruin the wonderful moments that Christ has in store for you. As Jesus said to Jairus, Don’t be afraid; just believe. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Christianity Today
******************

Celebrate Something ...
=======================
... **Better Than Halloween!**

On the day I’m writing this, it’s Halloween. But I’ve got something better to celebrate. You see, I’m a Christian. Christians celebrate life. Halloween celebrates death.

Halloween has its origins in the ancient pagan festivals in honour of the dead. These festivals are found in almost every ancient pre-Christian culture. In these festivals, on certain days, the dead were permitted to have contact with the world of the living.

In these pagan cultures, the living have always had an ambiguous relationship with the dead. On the one hand, the living feared the dead, because they could come back to harm them. But on the other hand, the living also celebrated the dead. Of course, one reason was because the dead were those whom we had loved in life. But the other reason was precisely to keep the dead happy and quiet, so they wouldn’t harm the living. That’s why in these pagan festivals it was customary to have a party and to offer the dead sweets and other kinds of foods for that very purpose.

The idea was to make friends with death, after all, we’re all going there!

The Christian faith is the very opposite to this. While the world celebrates death, Christianity celebrates life. For Christians death is not a friend, and will never be a friend. In 1 Corinthians 15:26, the Bible calls death an “enemy”. The word that the Apostle Paul uses here refers to someone who is hateful. Death is the ultimate enemy!

In the west, we live in a largely post-religious world, and so the fear of death remains. Although we consider ourselves so much more sophisticated than those ancient pagans, the ideas behind Halloween still fascinate many people. While we may think that people celebrate Halloween “just for fun,” our culture celebrates death very prominently in a myriad of ways through movies and music and through the many expressions of popular culture.

Christians do not celebrate death. But although we hate death, we face it with hope, and our sorrow is not like those who have no hope. Because the Bible tells us that the power of death has already been destroyed by Jesus Christ, who gives us the victory. Our victory will be seen on the day of resurrection.

Here is what Christians celebrate:

    *Christ has been risen from the dead. He is the first of a great harvest of all who have died.* - 1 Corinthians 15:20, NLT

That’s a much better kind of celebration! – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Cross Is An Invitation
==========================
*We ... see Jesus ... crowned with glory and honour because He suffered death, so that by the grace of God, He might taste death for everyone.* - Hebrews 2:9, NIV

I love to travel, and whenever I travel, I love to visit churches, especially those awe-inspiring cathedrals in Europe. I once drove from the Netherlands through Brussels, and right into southern France, and then back to the Netherlands, just to visit churches that I’d only ever seen in post-cards. And what was nuts about it was that I did it all in a weekend!
 
But beautiful buildings are not what Christianity is about.
 
Jesus didn’t die in a quiet place of meditation and reflection, but beside a busy road. In this way, He showed us that we must all eventually face Him and His sacrifice.
 
Jesus didn’t die under the roof of a beautiful temple, but under an open sky. In this way, He showed us that He died for all, and that His sacrifice knows no walls or boundaries.
 
Jesus didn’t die between two beautiful pieces of art, but between two wretched criminals. In this way, He showed us that He could think of no better place to be than with the broken and the lost.
 
The essence of Christianity is not found in any building, but in a person, our Saviour Jesus Christ. It is an open invitation to all, to believe and to live. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus Turns Your Endings ...
============================
... **Into New Beginnings**

*I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.* - Revelation 22:13

The sisters Mary and Martha thought that it had all ended, now that their brother Lazarus had died. Martha busied herself with the funeral arrangements, and Mary just cried and cried inconsolably.
 
What was the point of Jesus coming now? Lazarus had been in the grave for four days; at least the mourners were still there. He had come just in time to share in the grief. Even Jesus wept. It was the end. That’s how you mark endings, isn’t it? With tears?
 
Jesus goes to Mary and He says to her, “Do you believe?” (John 11:26), and although it is through a cloud of tears, she says, “Yes.”
 
Then Jesus goes to the tomb and cries out with the voice of the Son of the Living God, “Lazarus, come out!” And Lazarus emerged from the grave into the arms of those who loved him.
 
I don’t know how this year was for you, but I’m sure it wasn’t all good. We call it “the end of the year,” but the question is, “Do you believe?”
 
If you believe in the One who is the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End, the Resurrection and the Life, then all that seems an end, is only ever a new beginning in disguise. Do you believe? – Eliezer Gonzalez

God Fills Your Emptiness
========================
*He has put eternity into man's heart.* - Ecclesiastes 3:11, ESV

Did you know that the universe is 99.999% empty space? We can easily understand that as it applies to outer space, but did you know it also applies to our bodies? If that space were removed from all our bodies, the whole human race would take up the space of a sugar cube!
 
In a literal sense, there doesn’t seem to be much substance to people. If makes you wonder what there is about people to love. God knows… literally, because he tells us through the Bible that we are deeply, desperately, and continuously loved.
 
If death is the end of it all, then that’s all we are: just empty space, just wasted lives of no consequence.
 
But death isn’t the end! The Bible says: in God’s great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead (1 Peter 1:3).
 
Jesus has overcome death, so when you believe in him, he fills you with a new life that’s full of joy and hope and purpose.
 
All those who have accepted salvation in Christ have no more empty space. If you are his, Christ fills every part of your being with eternity. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Jesus is Your Saviour and Lord
==============================
*God will give you a grand entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.* - 2 Peter 1:11

It’s easy to just *say* “thank you”, without being truly grateful, but it’s often harder to show our gratitude.

Two blind men once came to Jesus and asked him to have mercy on them (Matthew 9:27–31). He healed them, and then he told them to **make sure that they told absolutely no one about what had happened**. Instead, they both raced off and started telling everyone what Jesus had done.

Yes, Jesus had saved them from their blindness – in this sense, he was their **Saviour**. But if they had been truly grateful, they should have done what Jesus asked them to do. In obeying Jesus, they would not only have been accepting him as their Saviour, but as their **Lord** as well.
 
There are many people who happily claim Jesus as their Saviour, but how many truly accept him as their Lord? As Jesus said on another occasion,

    *“Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?"* - Luke 6:46
 
Unlike those two blind men, are you grateful enough to let Jesus be both Saviour and Lord of your life? After all, Jesus can’t be your Saviour if he isn’t your Lord as well. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Remembering Keeps Your Faith Strong
===================================
*Remember the things I have done in the past. For I alone am God!* - Isaiah 46:9 NLT

God often tells us to remember, because he knows that we are prone to forget. Here are three things to remember that will help you get through tough times:
 
    1. **Remember who you are**

    *In Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith.* Galatians 3:26

    We are not abandoned orphans. No matter how sad you may be, remember that you are a child of God. Your can trust your Father in heaven.

    2. **Remember who you belong to**

    *Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine.* Isaiah 43:1

    You belong to God. You can only ever suffer as much as he allows, and he will always be right there with you in the midst of the storm.

    3. **Remember where you are going**

    *Our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Saviour from there, the Lord Jesus Christ.* Philippians 3:20

    Whatever you go through in this world is only a fleeting moment in the light of eternity. Remember that you belong to heaven and not to this world. Remember that you have a Saviour and his name is Jesus.
 
This world is like an obstacle course that tries to make us forget. We are only safe when we remember Jesus. – Eliezer Gonzalez

Use What’s In Your Hand
=======================
*His disciples answered, “Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?” “How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked.* – Matthew 15:32–34, NIV

When Jesus suggested to the disciples that he wanted to feed the enormous crowd of 4,000 people by the lake, the disciples were full of excuses. Too often we are the same.

Just as he did with his disciples beside the lake, Jesus doesn’t take any notice of our excuses at all. Instead, he simply asks us what we have in our hand.

I imagine that when the disciples said they had seven loaves and a few fish, they thought Jesus would have responded, “I see. You were right. That’s useless. Let’s think of another plan.” But that’s not what Jesus said at all. Instead he took what they had in their hands and turned it into more than enough to feed 4,000 people.

Don’t be frightened at the huge size of what Jesus asks us to do: to take the Bread of Life to the world. He doesn’t ask us to do the impossible. Not at all! He takes care of that.

All Jesus asks is that we give him what he has already put in our hands, no matter how humble or small, and he will do the rest. When you offer Jesus what’s in your hand, that’s when miracles happen.

Check what’s in your hands today. In faith, offer it to Jesus. Then stand back and watch what happens!

Beyond Indoctrination
=====================
*"Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."*  – Matthew 9:13

During approximatly 100 days between April 7 and mid-July 1994, it is estimated that between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Rwandans were killed, up to 70% of the Tutsi and 20% of Rwanda’s total population. This was the genocidal mass slaughter of the Tutsi minority and moderate Hutu, by members of the Hutu majority—many of them Christians.

Yes, the horrific reality is that those who rose up to barbarously hack their neighbours to death were **Christians** of all persuasions. The churches in Rwanda before the genocide tended strongly towards fundamentalism and legalism, and they still do today. Has nothing been learnt? How can this be? Because Christians have too often spent their energies indoctrinating people, rather than “gospelising” them.

In terms of priorities, God does not call us to be rooted and grounded in knowledge and standards, or to understand all doctrine or prophecy. God calls us, as our first duty, to be rooted and grounded in love, through the indwelling of Christ in our hearts (Ephesians 3:17–19). Religion based on any other foundation incurs the words of Christ:

    *“He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’ Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”* Matthew 25: 45-46.

What about you? Have you been truly gospelised? Or have you merely been indoctrinated? – Eliezer Gonzalez

The Coherence of Scripture
==========================

*Every word of God is pure.* - Proverbs 30:5, NKJV

Properly understood, the Bible is itself the strongest evidence for its truthfulness. But it must be properly understood. If you look at the Bible as you would consider any other book, then you might see apparent contradictions and problems. But the Bible is not like any other book.
 
Everything must be judged according to its purpose. Most people don’t understand what the purpose of the Bible is, so they fail to see its beauty.
 
The Bible was not given to us to explain scientific principles. It wasn’t to be a history of the human race. The Bible wasn’t intended to be a compendium of rules for right living. That’s not what it’s principally about. From beginning to end, the Bible has one primary purpose: to reveal Jesus Christ as the way to salvation (Luke 24:25–27; John 5:39).
 
Jesus is the key that unlocks the meaning of Scripture. When you understand that, then you can understand how “every Word of God is pure.” – Eliezer Gonzalez

You Will Be Reunited with Jesus
===============================

*I am married to you.* - Jeremiah 3:14, NKJV

Sixty years ago, Boris and Anna Kozlov were married for only three days before he had to ship out with his Red Army unit. When he returned, Anna and her family were gone – exiled to Siberia by Stalin’s purges. Then one day, on a chance encounter, they found each other again!

“I thought my eyes were playing games on me,” Anna said. “I saw this familiar looking man approaching me, his eyes gazing at me. My heart jumped. I knew it was him. I was crying with joy.”

80 years-old Boris had returned to visit his parents’ grave. As he stepped out of the car, he looked up to see Anna standing by her old house, where they had lived for the few days after the wedding.

“I ran up to her and said: ‘My darling, I’ve been waiting for you for so long. My wife, my life...”
 
This was an amazing reunion. However the book of Revelation (19:7–9) describes another amazing reunion between a bride and her husband. It will be when you are reunited with Jesus, face to face.
 
Don’t worry about whether Jesus will recognise you or not. No matter how life may take its toll on you, Jesus will always recognise you. Because you’re his. – Eliezer Gonzalez

You Can Have ...
================
... **an Overwhelming Assurance of Salvation**

*I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them away from me, for my Father has given them to me, and he is more powerful than anyone else. No one can snatch them from the Father’s hand.* - John 10:28–29, NLT

Sometimes I don’t feel an overwhelming assurance of salvation. But I'm thankful that feelings are not a reliable guide to spiritual reality. God knows how untrustworthy our feelings are. That’s why, in the Bible, he provides many times what I can only call an “overwhelming assurance of salvation.”

Look at Jesus’ promise in John 10:27–31. Jesus seals it with the identity of the Father and of the Son. There is nothing in the universe who can take away the eternal life that Christ has given you.

These words are absolute. If you listen to the voice of Jesus, and follow him, you have eternal life, and you will never perish.

The great people of the Bible all went through dark and difficult times. Elijah, Isaiah, and John the Baptist all felt in different ways that their connection with God was gone, that they had been abandoned, and that they were failures.

We must break the connection, in our minds, between our feelings and our salvation. Our assurance depends on God’s incredible, generous gift alone. – Eliezer Gonzalez
