The Gospel Message
******************

.. _df-GospelMessage:

The Gospel is for Free
======================
*Blessed are the poor in spirit.* - Matthew 5:3

True religion is the union of the heart with God. It is not being a member of a denomination, or simply being baptized. All these things may come into it, but they are not the essence of true religion. True religion is the spirit, the heart, the mind.

Jesus is saying in this verse, “Blessed are those who feel their need.” Isn’t it great that the blessings begin there? Here is the ladder of life from earth to heaven, and Jesus does not begin with “Blessed are the pure in heart.”

A pure heart is one that is not mixed up worldliness, selfishness, self-will, impurity, or wrong ambition. A pure heart gives God his place, places absolute concentration on God.

Suppose the Beatitudes had begun, “Blessed are the pure in spirit.” I’d have shut the book, “No good to me,” I’d have said. I’m glad the blessings do not start there. The blessings begin, “Blessed are the poor.” I can say, “Lord, I can buy that.”

The gospel is for free.

If God is going to give us something as infinite as eternity, how could we finite creatures ever earn it? It has to be free. The good news of the gospel is that all the good things we want are free. – Des Ford

The News that Travels Quickly
=============================
*And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.* - Romans 11:6

Grace is mentioned about 130 times in the New Testament alone. Paul begins and ends each of his epistles with it. Along with one or two literary relatives, it turned the western world upside down in the sixteenth century – we call that event the Reformation.

The news that travels quickly is either very bad or very good, usually the former. But in this instance, the latter. If the gospel were something trite like “Be good and God might save you,” it would hardly travel outside its hometown – the town of legalism.

But if instead the gospel is grace, and the gospel is joy, forgiveness, power, fruitfulness, mercy and a thousand other good things, we can understand how one day when understood it will take wings and cross all barriers.

In other words, when instead of telling people that if, if, if they are good God might love them, tell them of the God who “justifies the ungodly,” the man who “receives sinners,” the One who promised that “all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men.” Tell that, and it will travel at almost the speed of light.

Tell the world that grace is God’s unimaginable generosity. It led Him to give Christ, His unspeakable gift. It made him promise to supply, if we need it:

   *exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.* - Ephesians 3:20

– Des Ford

That's Grace
============
*For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son... (He) did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.* - John 3:16-17

Only as we recognize that grace is essentially for the graceless do we gather its essential sweetness. In the Old Testament, its synonyms in the Hebrew signify favor and loving kindness. Thus the word binds together both Testaments, signifying that God, because He is Love, is seeking sinners to bless and change them, and to fill their lives with fruitfulness, innocence and joy.

   *This Man receives sinners.* Luke 15:2

That’s grace.

   *Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men.* Matthew 12:31

That’s grace.

   *The one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out.* John 6:37.

That’s grace.

Love is grace. Mercy is grace. Forgiveness is grace. All gifts are grace. Joy is grace. Indeed you cannot think of any good thing that is not related to grace in one way or another. There could have been no grace whatsoever for us but for the fact that God the Son volunteered to take our place and redeem us.

   *Grace… came through Jesus Christ.* John 1:17

– Des Ford

Illustrations of Grace
======================
Remember Abraham praying for Ishmael. *"O that Ishmael might live before Thee!"* But our munificent heavenly Father not only gave him Ishmael in lasting existence but also Isaac, and descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven for we, if Christ’s, are Abraham's seed. He asked for the life of one, and God gave him millions. That's grace.

Think of Jacob. He prayed that God might guarantee him his bread and water, but what did God do? By the time Jacob came that way again he was rich, living high so to speak, and a man abounding in children and all good things.

See the prodigal son in his tattered clothes and almost broken spirit. He resolved to go to his father, for his father’s servants had bread enough and to spare, and ask to be made a servant. What happened to him? He was reinstated, given a ring, special shoes and gown, and a feast. That's a picture of divine grace in action.

Christ told umpteen stories about parties but gave only one mini-parable about a funeral (see Matthew 11:17). Similarly, the Old Testament ordered many feasts, but only one fast (the Day of Atonement).

No wonder we read:
    
    *The joy of the Lord is your strength.* - Nehemiah 8:10)

The Glorious Answer ...
=======================
... **To All Our Questions**

*And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus* – Ephesians 2:6.

In a book almost 2,000 years old, we are told that there were hundreds of people still alive in the days of Paul the Apostle, who had seen the risen Christ (1 Corinthians 15:6). We can believe this testimony because we have a prophecy from the risen Lord, affirming that his gospel would go to the end of the earth, beginning in the very place where he had been rejected and crucified (Acts 1:8).

How is it that neither the Jews nor the Romans could stamp out these witnesses who took the words of Christ to the edges of the known world? How did fishermen manage to overthrow long-accepted systems of idolatry and destroy the deities of Greece and Rome?

What does this mean? Here is the answer to all our questioning, and the answer is glorious.

If Christ is alive and interceding for us in the heavens above, then his gospel is true. All believers have had their sins forgiven (including past, present and future sins), and Christ’s perfect righteousness has been imputed to them. They are without condemnation, reckoned as already seated in the heavenly places. They are joyful possessors now of eternal life and the verdict of the Last Judgment. Could there be anything better? – Des Ford

Old Testament Heroes ...
========================
... **Pointed to the Cross**
 
*If you believed Moses, you would believe Me, for he wrote about Me.* - John 5:46

Isaac was the child of promise who had been miraculously born. He was under the sentence of death for three days while he travelled with his father, and he bore on his back the wood on which he was to be sacrificed. Now Christ, the true Isaac has come, and to show that, He is offered at the same site, the hill of Moriah. He too can say:

    *“The Father has not left Me alone. He that sent Me is with Me.”* - John 8:29

Long before Isaac, Noah, after emerging from the storm of the wrath of God, had offered sacrifices adjoining the saving wood of the ark. That sacrifice had symbolised a new covenant made with a new world – and so it was at Calvary. The fierce outpouring of divine wrath against evil fell on the One attached to Calvary's tree, that it might never fall on us.

God's wrath, of course, is not like ours, selfish and ungovernable. His is a holy wrath, the inevitable reaction of holiness against evil. God’s wrath is also a healing wrath that brings salvation and holiness to all who are in sympathy with it. Whenever wrath threatens, there is the ark of safety available to all who accept the invitation to “come.” – Desmond Ford

The Cross: ...
==============
...  **About More Than Just Forgiveness**

*God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement… He did it to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the One who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.* - Romans 3:24,26 NIV

If we want to understand the Cross, we need to understand that it is not just about forgiveness. It is also about the holiness of God.

Yes, it is a wonderful revelation of the love of God. All of our sins are but a grain of sand compared to the mountain of His forgiveness. All of our sins are just a dewdrop falling into the ocean of His mercy.

But the Cross reveals, first of all, the holiness of God. God Himself could not forgive sin until its penalty was paid. The Cross was necessary so that God might be just and the Justifier of all who believe.

The Cross is a microcosm of the universe that unfolds the heart of God. God is against sin, but God is for sinners. The Cross also unfolds the heart of man. Man is so sinful he'd destroy His God. The Cross tells the reality about heaven and about earth, about past, present, and future. To understand the mystery of the Cross is to have insight into all the mysteries of existence.

The Cross of Christ also proclaims, “There's more to come! Life is not just pain and death. There's resurrection and glory!" That, too, is part of the meaning of the Cross. – Des Ford

Calvary Has Given Us ...
========================
... **The Tree of Life**

*To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.* - Revelation 2:7

On numerous occasions, Scripture refers to the Cross as a tree. This is most appropriate since trees provide food and shelter; they are places of rest and beauty, and have, in themselves, the seed of continued life. In all these ways, every good tree points to the Cross of Christ.

Concerning both the tree of life in Paradise, and the tree of Calvary, we find that they are located "in the midst" (Genesis 2:9; John 19:18; Revelation 1:13; 5:6; 22:2). By this repeated phrase we are reminded of the centrality of Christ and his sacrifice. The Saviour at Calvary stands between God and man, between the Father and the Spirit, between life and death, between time and eternity, law and grace, judgment and mercy. The tree of life in the midst of Paradise also symbolized his Cross, since to find Christ as one's sacrifice is to find paradise.

Only if we can keep him in the centre of all beliefs and practices can all be well.
While a thief stealing from the tree in Eden was expelled from Paradise, another thief, millenniums later, was promised entrance into Paradise because he partook of the second tree. Calvary has transformed the tree of the knowledge of good and evil into a tree of life for all who believe. – Des Ford

Jesus Saves You ...
===================
... **Even When You Don’t Understand**

*Near the Cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.* - John 19:25

Jesus’ followers stood bewildered near the Cross. They did not understand why Jesus was allowing these terrible things to happen to him. He had overcome every other challenge in his life. Why didn’t he reveal his power and come down from the Cross?
 
Many times in life we ask the same question: why doesn’t God do something? Why is he allowing this great evil? There is a reason. We just have to trust that God will act in his own time. So have faith in God, especially when travelling through the valley of the shadow of death.
 
The Roman centurion who supervised the crucifixion of Jesus had ample time to observe everything that happened. He noticed the kind of person that Jesus was and heard every word he spoke:

    *The centurion seeing what had happened praised God and said, "Surely this was a righteous man.”* - Luke 23:47
 
This man who was responsible for the execution of Jesus confessed his faith in the Saviour. What a wonderful gospel; it can change even the hearts of those who crucify the Lord; it can transform enemies into friends. - Des Ford

Jesus Has Conquered Death ...
=============================
... ** For You**

*Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?* - 1 Corinthians 15:55

Jesus said:

    *“I am the Living One; I was dead, and behold I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.”* - Revelation 1:18
 
Jesus, by his death and resurrection, opened the way back to God and life for us. That is why, after he rose from the dead, those who were raised to life by his death went into the holy city (Matthew 27:53). It is the death and resurrection of Jesus that gives us an eternal home with God.

There have been many great religious leaders in the world, but all of them have surrendered to death. Only one has risen from the dead, and that is Jesus Christ. When our Lord rose from the dead, he turned the tables on sin and death. The song of the redeemed is, “O death, where now is your sting? O grave, where now is your victory?”
 
Death has been conquered! And Jesus says to all who follow him:

    *“Because I live, you also will live.”* - John 14:19

Christ’s Miracles and Parables ...
==================================
... **Teach Justification In Him Alone**

*To the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness.* - Romans 4:15

Justification concerns the provision of that righteousness which is alien to us and found in Christ alone. It is systematically presented as a doctrine in Romans, but it is found throughout the whole of Scripture. Even the miracles and parables of Christ set it forth.

For example, the leprous, the blind, the deaf, the dumb and the palsied, came just as they were, but the word of Christ declared them whole. They came just as they were, but they did not remain just as they were. Contact with Christ made the difference. His power alone worked the transformation as they submitted to it.

In the parables we have the lost pictured as helpless sheep, forfeited coins and degraded sons. Only loving grace made the rescue possible. The shepherd found the sheep, the woman found the coin, and the memory of the Father's love drew the prodigal. The prodigal confesses, as must every sinner, "I am not worthy," but the Father receives him nonetheless.

Justification is a declaring righteous, not a making righteous. But God does not pronounce the leper clean and leave him a leper. He does not pardon the rebel and then leave him to carry on his rebellion. The 'fruit of the Spirit' is the evidence that we have been 'born' of the Spirit. – Des Ford

Christ Has Justified Us ...
===========================
... **Through His Death**

*Just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people.* - Romans 5:18

Justification is the reception of the sinner just as he or she is, for Christ's sake. Sanctification, or transformation, is the result. The essence of justification is that God does for us what we could never do for ourselves. He accomplished our acquittal through Christ's life and death, which were not only substitutionary, but representative.

When Christ died, God counted it as though the whole human race died. His perfect life, given for us on the Cross, was put to the credit of the whole human race. Christ became what he was not, that we might become what we are not. (See 2 Corinthians 5:14, 21).

Sanctification begins with regeneration, which always accompanies the faith and penitence that mark justification. Sanctification concerns our state, which is always imperfect, whereas justification concerns our standing with God, which is always perfect.

Justification is concerned with what has been entirely done outside of us. The result of justification is that as faith lays hold of the gift of salvation, the Holy Spirit who inspires that faith begets a new life in seed form. Henceforth the believer, so to speak, is a person with two natures, the old and the new. – Des Ford

You Are Justified ...
=====================
... **Through Faith Alone**

*Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness.* - Genesis 15:6, NIV

That’s the pattern for all of us. Abraham was not declared righteous because of any of his good works, although he had done many. Neither did ceremonial nor ritualistic works justify him, for he was declared righteous before his circumcision. He was not even justified on the ground of his faith, for it was far from perfect. Remember that before this, he had distrusted God and lied about Sarah, saying she was his sister. And after God had declared him righteous, didn’t he fail when he used Hagar to produce a son? Abraham was not justified as a result of his fragile faith.

Abraham was justified as a result of the coming Seed, Jesus. Faith was no more than an outstretched hand. Faith is not the basis of God's gift. Everyone is justified by means of faith, that is, through faith; but not because of, or as a result of, faith. Justification through faith means justification through Jesus.

And how we all need justification! Not one of us is what we should be, could be, or would be. The perfect law demands not merely perfect outward performance but perfect attitude of heart, perfect motives from a perfect heart. There is no way we can offer these to God. Even a repentant murderer is still guilty of his cruel crime.

The reward has to be **all** of grace. Therefore, it is through faith and faith alone. – Des Ford

You Belong To God
=================
*You are not your own; you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.* - 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 RSV

The answer from Scripture to man's claim of self-ownership is clear, unequivocal and final. We are not our own because we were bought. We were delivered, if we will accept it. God's own Son valued us so highly that he would not leave us in the darkness of the shadow of condemnation and death. By his own agonies he saves us from our agonies, if we will let him.

My life is not my own, nor are my moments, talents, opportunities or health. They are all held in trust. To rightly use them is the rent for the space I occupy here on earth.

Why was Christ forsaken at the ancient cross? He was forsaken that we might forsake our habit of fleeing from the cross of life and the cross of the Gospel, which, if lifted, ultimately will lift us. For the cross of service, when embraced, becomes as wings to a bird and as sails to a ship. The sighs of Calvary, through the magic alchemy of our loving, Heavenly Father, ultimately become transfigured into the songs of Paradise.

We belong to God – every cell, every talent, every capacity for thought, feeling, and action. Those who accept the sacrificial principle of the Cross will find that instead of weight it will become wings. – Des Ford

Steady Your Soul ...
====================
... **at the Foot of the Cross**

*May I never boast except in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.* - Galatians 6:14

Must our lives always be threatened by sickness, frustration, disappointment and death? We live in a rebellious world where people have spat in the face of God, rejected infinite love, and where people have disobeyed the laws of life, and have forgotten that a judgment day is coming.

I wonder if you have heard of Amy Carmichael. One of the problems she dealt with in the approximately 38 books that she wrote was the meaning of pain. In one of her books, she wrote:

    There is only one place where we can receive, not an answer to our question, but peace. That place is Calvary. An hour at the foot of the Cross steadies the soul as nothing else can. “Oh, Christ, beloved, thy Calvary stills all our questions. Love that loves like that can be trusted about this." 

Our Lord is not only our Saviour but he is also our great example. He knew pain and shadows, and the worst pain, of course, was when it seemed that God had forsaken him. But God was still there. The Bible says,

    *"God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself."* 2 Corinthians 5:19

If the love revealed on the Cross cannot help people to be like the one who hung on the Cross, what more can God do? – Des Ford

Calvary: ...
============
... **the True Centre of Existence**

*We love him because he first loved us.* - 1 John 4:19, NIV

It is not the life of Christ, not the teachings of Christ, but his sacrificial death alone that provides the motivation we need in our Christian life. When, through faith, we focus our eyes upon Christ on the Cross, and lay hold of him as our personal Redeemer, we become united with the very power of the heavenly throne itself.

To know that we are loved, despite what we are, inclines us to love others, despite what they are. To see the evidence of the patience of God towards us inspires us to be patient with those around us.

To catch a glimpse of the hope of Paradise offered to a penitent thief arouses in us an undying hope which can transcend ”the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.”

The Cross is a constant reminder to us that through Jesus Christ, we too, died on that day. We are now his, and the only life that we have is the one he has given us.
Jesus’ death teaches us that we are not our own, for we were bought with a price. When we fully understand this great truth, we no longer want to live for ourselves, but for him who died for our sake, and was raised again. Any good that we do is but an echo of God’s own good. – Des Ford

Righteousness Through Christ
============================
*One has died for all; therefore have all died.* - 2 Corinthians 5:14, RSV

The Bible asserts that when Jesus died, then the whole wicked world potentially died in him and paid the price for its sins. Because of this, God is already reconciled to all men, so he says, “Be ye reconciled to God” (2 Corinthians 5:20).

Potentially all men are saved; all that individuals need to do is accept so great a salvation and by that act of acceptance, lay hold of eternal life.

Faith has no virtue in itself. It is merely the hand by which we receive the One in whom is all virtue. Thus righteousness does not come through faith in our faith; it comes through looking at Jesus Christ and believing what he says.

True belief when connected with a person always involves more than a mental assent. If we believe in a banker, we will entrust our money to him; if we believe in a doctor, we go to him with our physical ills. If we are to believe in Christ the Saviour and Lord, we must permit him to save us from our sins and we must obey him implicitly.

Thus it is that repentance, confession of sin, restitution, and obedience are always associated with conversion and regeneration. By surrender we are to consecrate our all to Christ, and by faith we are to receive his all. – Des Ford

We Have Passed ...
==================
... **From Death to Life**

*He who hears my word and believes in him who sent me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.* - John 5:24, NKJV

We were all ruined by Adam, our first representative. But Christ came as the second Adam, the second representative of the human race, and he redeemed us all. Legally it is so. Personally it becomes so as I believe it (1 John 4:17).

Only this can explain those mysterious sections of the Gospel narrative which tell us of the intensity of Christ's mental anguish when he sweat great drops of blood and later cried, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” It was not fear of death that explains Christ's agony. It was the awareness that he was suffering for the sins of the human race. He was forsaken of God, or so it seemed, that we might not be. On the Cross, Christ cried, "Why?” in order that we might never need to cry it.

The lightning bolts of judgement struck the innocent Son of God in order that the guilty might find safety at the seared site of Calvary. It is no travesty of justice. The unchangeable law of God was more honored by the death of the infinite Son than if the whole guilty human race had perished.

Furthermore, anyone who receives the blood-bought gift of righteousness cannot remain the same. The forgiveness given to rebel dissolves their spirit of rebellion. – Des Ford

Everyone Can Be Saved
=====================
*I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to everyone who believes ... For there is no distinction ... for the same Lord over all is rich to all that call upon him.* - Romans 1:16; 10:12, NIV

The religion of many people is like a headache: they have no desire to lose their head, but it hurts them to keep it. This leads to the question: Is Christianity hard or easy? Or put another way: does salvation depend mostly upon God's doing or mine?

The word gospel means "good news," but Christianity would not be good news if those with handicaps through heredity and environment were unable to be saved.

The Scriptures, however, promise that through the Gospel "he that is feeble ... shall be as David" (Zechariah 12:8). Of all who will ultimately be saved it will be written that they "out of weakness were made strong" (Hebrews 11:34).

Our salvation depends more upon God than upon us, for the Bible is emphatic that everyone, whatever their temperament or natural advantages, are powerless of themselves to live a righteous life,

    *Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be.* Romans 8:7, NKJV

To encourage all who become aware of their weakness it is written that,

    *God has chosen the foolish things of the world, ... the weak things of the world, ... and base things of the world, and things which are despised.* 1 Corinthians 1:27,28, NKJV

Heaven is for everyone who believes. – Des Ford

The “Good News” Religion
========================
*This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.* - Luke 15:2, NIV

Religion, as with all other good things, is a two-sided coin. There are only two religions in the world, and only one of them is pleasing to God. The popular religion of the world says, "Be good and God will love you." This religion is human-centered, works-centered, subjective, and vain.

Bible religion, in contrast – the **Good News** religion – is that Christ came into the world to save sinners. He loves and accepts us even while we are sinners. It is this acceptance that changes us. God "justifies the ungodly" (Romans 4:5, NKJV).

The glory of the New Testament religion is that we are saved on the basis of what Christ has done, not by what we do; by what he has felt, not by what we feel. Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone.

The righteousness by which we are justified is 100 percent, but it is imputed rather than imparted. The righteousness of sanctification is imparted by the Holy Spirit, but it is never 100 percent in this life.

The believer has not need to be anxious about what God thinks of him but only what God thinks of Christ, his Substitute. The believer has no need to make his peace with God, for Christ has already done that, and Christ is his Peace. – Des Ford

God Is Not Exclusive
====================
*There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.* - Ephesians 4:4–6

There is just one family of God, though its members are scattered among many groups. According to the New Testament,

    *“no man can call Jesus Lord save by the Holy Spirit.”* 1 Corinthians 12:3

Thus, anyone having Christ as Saviour and Lord is a member of his family, of his church. This is true, even though not all believers see the particulars of duty alike. They are none the less God’s children.
 
You don’t have to have a perfect understanding of Scripture to be God’s child. Our God looks at the heart, the inclination, the will, and where there is the intent to please God and obey his known will, there that person is regarded as his child. Accurate knowledge is not required. Neither is perfection called for. If it were, all of us would be excluded.
 
Read the story in Luke 1:5-20, where Zechariah the priest and his wife Elizabeth are described as perfect before God, keeping all his commandments. Yes, this is the way they were described, even though both their understanding of the will of God and their performance of it was defective.
 
Thank God that the condition of heaven is the acceptance of the perfect righteousness of Christ, not our tattered, grimy human robes of our own characters. – Des Ford

The Gospel Is Better Than Law
=============================
*The law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.* John 1:17, NKJV

Any religion that eclipses the Cross of Christ by the Mount of Sinai is a false religion; in whatever church it may happen.
 
The law says, *“Do this and you will live.”*
But the Gospel says, **“Live and you will do.”**

The law says *“Pay me what thou owe.”*
The Gospel says, **“I freely forgive you everything.”**

The law says, *“The wages of sin is death.”*
But the Gospel says, **“The gift of God is eternal life.”**

The law says, *“The soul that sins shall die.”*
The Gospel says, **“Whoever believes in me, though he were dead, yet he will live.”**

The law says, *“Get yourselves a new heart.”*
The Gospel says, **“I will give you a new heart.”**
 
The law says, *“You will love or else.”*
The Gospel says, **“Here is love: not that we’ve loved God, but that He loved us and gave Himself a sacrifice for our sins.”**

When the law was given at Mount Sinai, *3,000 people died in a matter of days.*
When the Gospel was proclaimed at Pentecost, **3,000 people lived.**

*Three thousand sermons on the law won’t convert one person.*

**One sermon on the Gospel will convert 3,000.** – Des Ford

Believe in Jesus

*He who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.* - John 5:24, NKJV

Nearly one hundred times (98 to be exact), John's Gospel uses the word, "believe." It’s there in almost every chapter.

Believing is receiving, and receiving is believing.

    *"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, to them who believe on His name."* John 1:12

Chapter after chapter, John asks, "Do you believe?" The person who believes in Jesus is not condemned.

    *He who believes on Him is not condemned: but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.* John 3:18, NKJV

We have eternal life now (John 5:24), in Christ. The moment I believe, I am not only not condemned. I am justified!

Justification is not forgiveness. In a practical sense, it includes forgiveness, of course. But the word means much more. It means to be treated as innocent. The essence of the Gospel – the Good News – is that God calls the repentant sinner perfect the moment he or she believes. Though we are not good, God declares us righteous, for Christ's sake.

John's Gospel is asking, "Do you believe? Have you received? Do you have life eternal? Have you received the favourable verdict of the Last Judgment now?" – Des Ford

The Nature of Our God
*********************


God Creates ...
===============
... **What is Beautiful and Good**

*He has made everything beautiful in its time.* - Ecclesiastes 3:11

Why does God permit this world to be the university of hard knocks? The first thing to be said is that if you believe that God is a God of love, you have one problem: you have to explain the problem of evil. But if you don't believe that God is love, you have a million problems: the problem of good.
 
Isn’t it strange for every thousand people who ask the question of why there is evil, no one poses the question of why there is good? That’s a much bigger problem by a factor of a million to one.

Whoever made us could have made all our senses to give us constant pain, but he made all our senses to minister joy. Otherwise why isn't every sound a discord and every taste bitter? Why?

So if you don’t believe that God is love, you have a million problems. You have to explain beauty, truth, and friendship. You have to explain why the world is made so that it is filled with love and family relationships and friendships that can lift us above every sorrow.

Consider the great blessings of life. We usually point out calamity and loss because these are the exception to life. Every life is crammed with mercies, in spite of its pain. – Des Ford

God Gives Meaning to Everything
===============================
*You believe in God; believe also in me.* - John 14:1b, NIV

The main reason for unbelief ultimately, is that people only believe what they wish to believe. After all, a small eyelid can shut out the entire sun!

William Paley, a great favourite of mine, gave this illustration: If you walked in a desert and your foot kicked a stone, you wouldn’t think about it. But if you kicked a watch, you would get down and look at it. And you would marvel at it: the hard case to protect it, the glass so you could see, the proportionate moving of the hands. And when you took the back off and you saw the delicate mechanism and wheels and spring, you would say, “What a wonderful thing!” Then what if, as you hold it in your hands, suddenly another watch springs out? You pick up the second watch and you look at it, and suddenly yet another one comes out.

Paley is arguing two things: Design and Fertility. The watch is not like a stone. It is designed. And in his illustration, it is fertile. The watch, of course, is a symbol of us. Why isn’t everything in nature sterile?

Without God, nothing has meaning. If you take God away, you have annihilated everything that is good in the universe, every elevated joy of the mind, and every uplifting and ennobling love. – Des Ford

How To See God in Everything
============================
*Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.* - Matthew 5:8–9, NIV

What wonderful things are contained in Jesus’ words! What we are determines what we see. This verse says that life is a mirror. It promises all sorts of delights to those who get into a right relationship with Jesus. In that relationship, we will see God in everything.

We will see God in nature. If an atheist looks up at the stars, he doesn’t see stars. He says, “Look at all the cold, empty space between those lights.” If you are a believer, you say, “Look at all those glorious candles up there: diamonds that God has scattered in the night.” When you are a Christian, your eyes are opened, and you can see God in nature.

When you are a Christian, you can also see God in the providences of your own life—in everything. The Christian sees the miraculous working of God in his own life, just as in the writings of the Old Testament prophets.

What we see depends on what we are. Because life is a mirror, we will reflect the love of God back to the world. So Jesus tells us: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God” (Matthew 5:9, NRSV). Christ “is our peace” (Ephesians 2:14). Having received peace, we begin to shed it abroad. - Des Ford

Study the Scriptures
====================
*These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.* - John 20:31, NKJV

From time to time we feel as barren and as fruitless as Aaron’s rod before it budded (Numbers 17). We sometimes feel as empty as the widow’s cruse of oil (1 Kings 17), as desperate as sinking Peter (Matthew 14), and as frustrated as the disciples who fished all night and took nothing in their nets (Luke 5).

Read these stories carefully, for this is a common, recurring, human experience. But is it necessary?

There is One who overcame the world, and who not only said that all authority in heaven and on earth had been given to him, but that he would be with us always.

True religion is eternal life lived in the midst of time—in the present. True religion is lived by the power of, and in the company of, God. The original sin that brought misery upon us all happened when man tried to be independent of God (Genesis 3:5).

When our Lord Jesus rose from the dead, he breathed upon his disciples and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit” (John 20:22). In doing this, he was saying, “Because of the Cross, you need never walk alone. Because of the Cross, through me, the omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient God has come to dwell alongside you, and inside you, now and forever.” – Des Ford

Rules Are Not Enough
====================
*Show me Your ways, O Lord; Teach me Your paths. Lead me in Your truth and teach me, For You are the God of my salvation.* - Psalm 25:4–5, NKJV

Issues are rarely right or wrong. Often they are between what is bad, and which is less bad. A wise person learns that “when two duties conflict, one ceases to be a duty.”

Error lies close to truth. Because values constantly come into conflict, the Christian is never relieved from the “strain” of faith: the necessity of constantly throwing oneself afresh upon the guiding Spirit of God. Amid life’s bewildering circumstances, faith always looks beyond self to God, the Source of wisdom and strength, for each moment’s new decision.

Christians will find mere rules quite inadequate. Rules must change with situations, though principles never change. Only the prayerful, studious Christian will move wisely most of the time, even in the wider arena of compromise.

Is compromise easy for the Christian? Never! Can a Christian avoid compromise altogether? Never! Our lives are a mixture of change and stability, so every Christian will learn to adapt, while having unyielding loyalty to principle.

One day soon all the greys and all the blacks will be gone—morally as well as physically—and we will walk together in rainbow hours of everlasting day. – Des Ford

Thank God That ...
==================
... **Christ is Our Judge**

*For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to that he has done, whether good or bad.* - 2 Corinthians 5:10, NKJV

Who is this Judge of all the earth before whom we each must stand? The text referred to "the judgment seat of Christ." Did you ever think about that? Listen:

    *The Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son.* John 5:22, NKJV

The same story is found also in Romans 2:16:

    *God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.* NKJV

It is by Jesus Christ through whom God will judge the secrets of men. It wasn't for nothing that Paul added, "according to my gospel." A major part of the Good News is that One with our human nature, the Son of man, our Elder Brother, is to be our Judge.

The Crucified One is to be the Judge of sinners. Good News indeed! This is where the judgment differs from the tribunals of our day. It is not to be just an indictment because of sins committed. In fact, the real issue is not the sin question primarily but the Son question. The Judge himself has declared:

    *He that believes in him [Christ] is not condemned; but he who does not believe* **is condemned already** *, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.* John 3:18, NKJV

– Des Ford

No Condemnation
===============
*God will not take away a life; he will devise plans so as not to keep an outcast banished forever from his presence.* - 2 Samuel 14:13 NRSV

As Adam represented the race in Eden, so Christ – the second Adam (1 Corinthians 15:45) – represents humanity at the cross:

    *One has died for all; therefore all have died.* 2 Corinthians 5:14, NRSV

When Christ died for the “sins of the world” (John  3:16), God counted it that you paid the price for your sinfulness. The Bible tells us that because of Adam’s disobedience, everyone who has ever lived is sinful and disobedient by nature. So Jesus, the ‘second Adam’ has paid the penalty for sin by his perfect life and his death on behalf of everyone.

Now, whosoever will may come. Now, all sins will be forgiven. Now, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins because the claims of the righteous, eternal law have been met. We have died through our Substitute and Representative, Jesus.

God will not ask us to pay the price a second time if we abide in Christ.

    *"You are complete in him."* Colossians 2:10, NKJV

and

    *"accepted in the beloved."* Ephesians 1:6 KJV

so

    *There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.* Romans 8: 1 NRSV

If Calvary does not move us, God has nothing better to convince us. The Cross is the centre and the basis of Christianity. To refuse the Cross is to treat our own destiny with contempt, but glad-hearted acceptance begins life eternal. – Des Ford

Christ’s Resurrection ...
=========================
... **Is Open To All**

*Taste and see that the Lord is good.* - Psalm 34:8, NKJV

The establishment of Christianity is the most significant fact in the whole history of the world.  And it happened so strangely!

A handful of people who had been discouraged and broken-hearted were suddenly transformed. They went about telling people that they had seen their dead friend walking, talking, and glorious.

These witnesses voluntarily encountered recurring danger. They undertook tremendous labours,  persecution, suffering, and frequently, martyrdom. They had no certain end in life except for ridicule. All for the sake of a dead man whom they claimed was now alive. This strange story has changed the course of history, revolutionized the way we live, and changed millions of lives for the better.

The reserve in the resurrection accounts in Scripture is very striking. If I had been writing them, I would have had the risen Christ drop in on Pilate one dark night, and Herod on another. But there is no such spectacular stuff in the Gospel record. So factual is the record, that it says that on one occasion when Jesus appeared, there were some who doubted it was he (Matthew 28:17).

However, there is another evidence open to all – that of experience. "Taste and see." Throughout the ages, millions of transformed lives have testified to Christ's resurrection power.

This power is now available to all who will believe. – Des Ford

God Pours His Love ...
======================
... **Into Our Hearts**

*We know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love.* - Romans 5:5, NLT

God, who is our maker and preserver, is love, and the love of God is poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given to us. God’s love is just as infinite as his wisdom and his power. It is a love that with patience and forgiveness invites the worst as well as the so-called best, saying,

    *For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.* John 3:16, NKJV

Whoever believes God’s promises and takes hold of Christ receives love. Now the sky above is a richer blue, and the grass around a deeper green. Now we see in all those around us the purchased fruit of the blood of Christ. Now we know that despite our imperfections, we are loved and accepted.

“You are complete in him” and “accepted in the beloved” and “without condemnation” (Colossians 2:10; Ephesians 1:6; Romans 8:1).

    *“If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin.”* 1 John 1:7

It is in this reality of God’s Word that we must learn to live. – Des Ford

The Real Missing Link
=====================
*When the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?* - Luke 18:8, NIV

For over a century and a half, paleoanthropologists have searched for the “missing link” – the supposed ancestors of modern man. Occasionally, a very small bone has been magnified in significance and turned into a “missing link”. But one by one, all these have been dismissed as wrong: either errors or outright fraud.

This is not just true for the origins of humanity. In fact, this is the greatest riddle of evolution. While Darwin argued that new species emerge through a slow, gradual accumulation of tiny mutations, the fossil record reveals a very different scenario. It demonstrates the sudden emergence of whole new species, with no apparent immediate ancestors.
 
Where is the trail of the intermediates, the missing links? Typically, the palaeontologist will tell you simply, that these fossils haven’t been found yet.

This dilemma is merely the result of something else that is missing in our world today. While the missing links of evolution are still missing, there is also another link that is missing in those who reject the Creator God. Millennia ago our Lord had already diagnosed the problem of our time.

It is faith that is missing at the heart of our society today. (Luke 18:8) – Des Ford

Keep Jesus Central ...
======================
... **in Your Life**

*And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgement.* - John 16:8, NASB

If we don’t understand our world and the reasons for its moral chaos, then we are like a boxer forced to fight with his eyes bandaged. Our world is very sick with an exceedingly contagious illness.

In a single word, the Bible, gives the reason for our dilemma: sin. But if you search modern books or magazines, it is quite unlikely you will come across that word. There’s also another missing word: God.

A century and a half ago, Charles Darwin wrote his 'Origin of the Species', which became the bible for evolutionists in every country of the world. The key idea of this influential book is *chance* – believing that all things arrived through luck, and not by the word of God.

Darwin robbed humanity of hope, the basic staple of existence. Nobody believes in Utopia any more. By dismissing God, sin, Christ, the Bible, hope and meaning, the doctrine of organic evolution leaves humanity lost and hopeless.

The main reason for rejecting Darwinism is that in dismissing Genesis we lose the doctrine of the Fall. If man is not spiritually lost, he does not need a Saviour. If Christ becomes irrelevant, then Christianity itself is dissolved.

They key challenge in every person’s life is to keep Christ central in their lives.

Fullness: ...
=============
... **Available in Jesus**

*Out of his fullness we have all received.* - John 1:16, NIV

Jesus is God's 'unspeakable gift' (2 Corinthians 9:15 KJV). Though he was rich, for our sake he became poor, that we through his poverty might become rich. In Christ we have all else as well: righteousness, wisdom, sanctification, and redemption.

Jesus is our Boaz, our kinsman Redeemer. He is the Lord of the harvest who invites us to his banquet, and speaks tenderly to us. He orders his angelic messengers to “drop handfuls ... [on] purpose” (Ruth 2:16) for us that we might always have as much as we need, and be blessed.

In Jesus is found all the fullness of God and heaven. Humanity has a heart that is bigger than the world, however, God be praised; there is such a thing as all fullness available! God “has set eternity in our hearts” that we might be contented with nothing less than Jesus. We eat at his table, and are satisfied, and there is still an abundance left over. – Des Ford

For By Grace are You Saved
**************************


Justified in Jesus
==================
The whole world has been justified in Jesus. Sadly, not all the world knows.

The essence of true religion is not to tell people, ‘If you are good, God will love you.’ That’s a hopeless sort of affair. When are we going to be good enough? Is 80 per cent goodness sufficient? 85 per cent? 90, 95, 99.999 per cent? That’s a hopeless thing.

No, no. We are to tell people that they were already redeemed. They have been reconciled to God by the death of God’s Son. Because of that, whosoever will, may come.

We do not come in our own righteousness. We don’t have any. We have only:

    *filthy rags for garments...* Isaiah 64:6
    
    *Our *whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores.* Isaiah 1:5-6 KJV

If you heard something described like that for sale it would not be a good recommendation for an investment. **Nothing good in it from top to bottom. Inside or out!**

The good news of the gospel is that you’ve been reconciled to God! You come to God in the righteousness of Another. Jesus took the sin of others. We take his righteousness. A beautiful, divine exchange!

It’s like a princess marrying a pauper. She gets his debts, he shares in the kingdom! That’s the way the gospel works. That’s what the gospel is about. – Des Ford, Romans 8:27-32,  adapted from “The Crises of Christ: His Baptism”

Made Clean
==========
*Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean* - Matthew 8:2

Christ’s Sermon calls upon us to pray for our enemies, to bless those who curse us, do good to them that hate us. We are never to worry, never to have two masters, to seek first the kingdom of God, and to put our treasures in heaven.

You feel like the leper. Which is why Matthew ends the Sermon with the leper crying, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”

When you read the Sermon on the Mount honestly, you will want to come to Jesus. You will say, ”I’d like to be doing that but I’m a long way short. I am yet a leper, Lord. Make me clean.”

Jesus will respond, “I am willing. Be clean!” (Matthew 8:3). He will show us his cross, and, as we accept it, we will be clean “immediately” (Matthew 8:3), in a moment.

And in God’s good time, he will give us the virtues and the lifestyle of this Sermon. The virtues and values of this Sermon are what the Christian must ever aim for; yet the Christian never places trust in its fulfillment. Our hope of eternal life is in trusting what Jesus has done, never in what we are doing.

It is only as we come to Christ as lepers that he will make us clean. – Des Ford

Declared Righteous
==================
*Just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men.* – Romans 5:18, NIV

Justified is the opposite of condemned. Condemned does not mean to make bad. It means to declare bad. Justify does not mean to make righteous. It means to declare righteous.

We were ruined in Adam without asking for it. We have been redeemed in the Last Adam, Christ, without asking for it.
 
Justification is not forgiveness. In a practical sense, it includes forgiveness, of course. But the word means much more. It means to be **treated** as innocent.

The gospel says that God does not see in you and me the likeness of a sinner. God only sees the likeness of his Son. The standing of the Christian is always perfect even though the state of the Christian is never perfect.

Justification is over us all of our lifetime. Don’t think it just happens when you become a Christian. Justification is over you all of your life. Justification always determines your standing before God.

In God’s sight, you lived in Jesus, you died in Jesus, you were buried in Jesus, you rose with Jesus. In God’s sight you are already seated in heavenly places with Jesus - see Ephesians 2:6. That’s why we read,

    *Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the righthand of God.* - Colossians 3:1

God counts that we are risen with Christ, so believe that today, knowing that you're a righteous child of God. – Des Ford

God Sees You ...
================
... **As If You’d Never Sinned**

*You will tread our sins beneath your feet; you will throw them into the depths of the ocean!* - Micah 7:19

How could God say that this of David:

    *My servant David, who kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart, doing only that which was right in my sight.* - 1 Kings 14:8

after he had broken the sixth and seventh commandments?

When we repent, God casts our sins into the depths of the seas; as far away as the east is from the west, God removes our transgressions from us. The God, who could say of that of sinful David, is the same God who counts us as sinless for Christ's sake, when we trust in the Saviour.

Jesus told His disciples, “You have already been cleansed” (John 15:3). Two chapters earlier we find them far from clean: they are wrangling as to who would be greatest, and refusing to wash one another's feet. Jesus washed their feet, and pronounced, “You are clean” (John 13:10). Later, in prayer, He tells the Father, “They have kept your word” (John 17:6).

When God looks at us, He sees us through the Cross. Though we have failed in many ways to keep the word of God, yet God for Christ's sake says of us, “You are clean. You have kept My word.”

We are “accepted in the Beloved” (Ephesians 1:6 KJV). We are “complete in Him” (Colossians 2:10). That’s the gospel. – Des Ford

God Cares For You
=================
*Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.* - Matthew 10:29–31

Some people don’t pray, because after all, does God really care? In this world alone, there are six billion people. Is God like the old woman who lived in a shoe, who had so many children, she knew not what to do? No!

In Matthew 10:29-31, Jesus teaches about a God who attends the funeral of every sparrow. God cares about the details.

On one occasion God contacted a man named Ananias in Damascus, and said to him:

    *"Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.* - Acts 9:10-12

That's not bad for specifics: the name of God's servant, Ananias; the name of the street he was to go to, “Straight”; the name of the owner of the house he was to go to, “Judas” (another Judas; not the one who betrayed Jesus); the name of the man who needed help, “Saul”; and the city he came from, “Tarsus.” And a final detail: "But remember, Ananias, you will be interrupting Saul during his devotions."

Does God care? He cares for every detail. God counts the hairs of our head. God attends the funeral of every sparrow. – Des Ford

God’s Grace Surpasses ...
=========================
... **All Our Hopes**

*God ... raised us up with Christ ... in order that in the coming ages He might show the incomparable riches of His grace, expressed in His kindness to us in Christ Jesus.* - Ephesians 2:4–7, NIV

Grace shows us that God is seeking sinners to bless them and change them, and to fill their lives with fruitfulness, innocence and joy. This is because God is what He says he is – Love. 

We need to tell the world that grace is God's unimaginable generosity. It led God to give us Christ, God's “gift that is too wonderful for words!” (2 Corinthians 9:15 CEV). It led God to promise to supply as we need it, “exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think” (Ephesians 3:20, KJV).

Remember the paralytic being lowered into the room where Christ is preaching (Matthew 9:1-7). The suffering man hopes for physical restoration. What does Christ, the generous Saviour do? He not only gives the man what he hopes for, but also something more wonderful.

    *“Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.”* - Matthew 9:2, NIV

Now remember the starving prodigal son in his tattered clothes, with his almost broken spirit (Luke 15:11–32). He resolves to go to his father. His father's servants have bread enough to eat and to spare, so the son will ask to be made a servant. What happens? The son is reinstated in his father's house! He is given a ring, special shoes, a valuable robe – and a feast. This is a picture of divine grace in action. – Des Ford

That’s Grace!
=============
*For the grace of God has been revealed, bringing salvation to all people.* - Titus 2:11

    *“God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son ... Not . . . to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.”* - John 3:16-17
    
That's grace!

    *“This man welcomes sinners.”* - Luke 15:2
    
That's grace!

    *”People will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy.”* - Matthew 12:31 NRSV
    
That's grace!

    *“Whoever comes to me I will never drive away.”* - John 6:37 NIV
    
That's grace!

Love is grace. Mercy is grace. Forgiveness is too. Joy is grace. All gifts are grace!

    *The Spirit writes the law in our hearts and causes us to walk therein.* - Ezekiel 36:26-27; Hebrews 8:10
    
That's grace indeed. God makes us want to do what we ought to do, then enables us to do it!

    *The Spirit and the bride say, 'Come!' And let him who hears say, 'Come!' Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life'.* - Revelation 22:17
    
“Free gift" – that's grace!

No wonder the Spirit painted a gloriously exciting picture in “The Parable of the Hidden Treasure” (Matthew 13:44). Here is a man stumbling his way through the field of Holy Scripture. He suddenly discovers a treasure – the treasure of grace!

Are you that joyful treasure-hunter? If not, why not?

Come. All is free! Come. All is grace! – Desmond Ford

The Cross of Jesus: ...
=======================
... **God’s Greatest Revelation!**

*I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.* - 1 Corinthians 2:2
 
The Cross of Calvary is God’s greatest revelation of truth. It reveals to us the true nature of the God we worship – a God who is not only righteous and holy, but who is also prepared to fully sacrifice himself for us. No other god ever sacrificed himself for his people. Instead, other gods demanded sacrifices from their people.
 
Our God gave himself as a sacrifice for us so that we could be totally free of condemnation.
 
The Cross was the true altar on which the Lamb of God was slain for the sins of the world. Jesus’ blood was shed there for your sins so that you would be set free from the law’s condemnation (John 3:18; Romans 8:1).
 
The very shape of the Cross suggests the length, the breadth, the depth and the height of God’s love. It points to heaven where our Lord came from, but is rooted in the earth that he came to redeem. The outstretched arms are an invitation to all men, even his crucifiers, to come to him. Men may reject an angry god, but how can they reject the suffering One who was prepared to die for them? - Des Ford

You Are Not Under Law ...
=========================
... **But Under Grace**

*For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace.* - Romans 6:14

We do not work to the Cross, but from the Cross. The power of sin is never removed till the guilt of sin has been taken away (Romans 6:14). Our actual experiential freedom from sin comes as we bask in the forgiveness of God. Our gratitude and love for God's great gift becomes a torrent, washing away our defilement. As we sense that we are no longer under law, but under grace as regards our acceptance with God, we receive freedom over the habits that have long bound us.

We come to recognise that the Law is a perfect standard of righteousness, but we acknowledge that it can never give us a perfect standing. The Law is not even a means of sanctification except as it drives us to Christ and indicates what the will of God is. The New Testament shows a decided opposition to law – not to law as a standard, only to law as a method.

The justification I have received covers my past, present, and future (See John 13:10; Romans 8:1; and 1 Corinthians 1:30). The Christian should not look upon himself as being continually in and out of grace because of his mistakes and failures. He or she is “accepted in the beloved” and “complete in him”. – Des Ford

There Will Be Many ...
======================
... **Surprises in Heaven**
 
*If You, Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?* - Psalm 130:3, NKJV

What can be said to those millions of grieving Christians who have a question about the eternal destiny of a loved one? As a gnat cannot swallow the Atlantic, neither can anyone comprehend all the purposes and all the knowledge of God, and all His plans.

We have a loving Saviour who came to seek and save the lost. God’s mercy is infinite. When we lose a loved one, we look at their life, and sometimes the bad stands out. However, unless what Psalm 130:3 says about God is true, we're all done for. Of course, the good news of that text is that it is saying that God delights in forgiveness.

**When Christ tells us that we are to forgive seventy times seven, it’s what that tells us about God that is more encouraging than what it tells us about our duty. It tells us that God forgives infinitely if we seek his forgiveness.**

We are forbidden in Scripture to judge the hearts of men, because we cannot know their motives (1 Corinthians 4:5). We shouldn’t be dogmatic about how it’s going to turn out for others in eternity. Only God knows.

The salvation of many is going to be an absolute surprise to all of the rest of the saved. – Des Ford

God Adds His Grace ...
======================
... **to our Infirmities**

*My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.* - 2 Corinthians 12:9, NIV

When Daniel’s friends were in the burning, fiery furnace, their enemies thought they were going to be burnt to a crisp. Then they saw God walking with them. The king was surprised:

    *“Look!” he answered, “I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire; and they are not hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.”* Daniel 3:25 NKJV

The only thing the three Hebrew worthies lost in the fiery furnace was their bonds. They were burnt away, leaving the faithful three in perfect freedom.

God is with us in our fiery furnaces. We don’t have to bear anything alone. That’s why Paul could say,

    *Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me.* 2 Corinthians 12:9

That is not easy to do. I hate weaknesses; I detest them. But God knows better. He says, “You must learn that strength has nothing to do with you—it’s mine!” The record in Corinthians is very clear. The Lord says to Paul, “I’m not going to take away your weaknesses, Paul. My grace is sufficient for you.”– Des Ford

Have the Verdict ...
====================
... **of the Last Judgment: Today**

*By grace you have been saved, through faith –  and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God – not by works, so that no one can boast.* - Ephesians 2:8-9, NIV

Sin is like a burden on us, like a law over us, and a disease within us. Sin is our creditor, our tyrant, and our traitor. The guilt of sin, the power of sin, the presence of sin can only be dealt with by Jesus Christ and his Gospel.

God removes the guilt of sin the moment we believe. The power of sin is simultaneously crushed in principle as we behold God's great love for the sinner. Sin's presence no longer reigns in us, though our sinful nature remains. **Therefore, we dare not depend upon our sanctification for acceptance with God.**

We are:

    *"accepted in the Beloved"* Ephesians 1:6, KJV
    *"complete in him"* Colossians 2:10, KJV
    *without "condemnation"* Romans 8:1
    *and made to "sit with him [Christ] in the heavenly places"* Ephesians 2:6, RSV

The only true religion asserts with Scripture that we are saved through faith, the gift of God, and not by any good that we do ourselves. If, however, we forget this religion of the Bible, and trust anything in ourselves for acceptance and for peace, we are inviting turmoil and stress.

The believer looks for comfort only to Christ’s gift of righteousness. When the believer accepts what Christ did for him on the Cross, he has the verdict of the last judgment already, and for as long as he believes. – Des Ford

You Are A Winner ...
====================
... **Through Christ**

*In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.* - Romans 8:37, NIV

According to General Douglas MacArthur, "In war, there is no substitute for victory." This is true of the Christian conflict also.

"What?" asks a concerned Christian. "Why this talk of war? War implies effort, struggle. I believe in God’s gift of salvation by faith alone."

Salvation is by faith alone. However, the evidence that we have received so great a salvation is the experience of being more than conquerors in the daily clash with evil.

It was Paul, the apostle of justification by faith alone, who had so much to say about the Christian warfare. Read his comments in Romans 7:23; 13:12; 2 Corinthians 6:7; 10:4; Ephesians 6:17; and 1 Thessalonians 5:8.

Paul tells us that we are more than conquerors through Jesus! Conquerors? That's good. More than conquerors? That's better!

And not "so shall it be one day," but we are conquerors right now, this very day. And the method of victory Paul offers is the best method of all. "Through him who loved us." That takes a lot of the strain out of it. The victory is not through us, but through Christ.

Even when discussing warfare Paul does not depart from his chief theme: Christ. The Saviour is Alpha and Omega – the beginning and the end – not only in rescuing us from sin and offering us full and free salvation, but in the entire Christian experience. – Des Ford

Let Christ’s Love ...
=====================
... **Transform You**

*We, who with unveiled faces all contemplate the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.* - 2 Corinthians 3:18, NIV

Trying to improve our characters, apart from Christ’s way, is as though the crew of a sailing ship tried to get the becalmed vessel moving by pushing against the masts; or like a drowning man trying to lift himself out of the water by pulling at the hair of his own head.

Paul taught us the better way. We cannot change ourselves any more than we can birth ourselves.

    *"Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed."* Romans 12:2

We do not transform ourselves. We are transformed as we contemplate the Lord’s glory.

We can be more than conquerors! (Romans 8:37). Yes, you and me. Not by gritting our teeth, not by more resolutions, but regularly exposing our hearts and minds to the Chief Among Ten Thousand, the One Altogether Lovely.

Christ has already crushed the head of the serpent. Christ has judged and cast out the prince of this world, and his victory is for us. It is Christ who puts enmity between us and evil. When the heart is filled with the most precious thing in the universe – Christ's love – then the alternatives offered by temptation appear in all their tawdry shabbiness.

In the face of even colossal enticements, we victoriously cry, "I don't want them! I'd rather have Jesus." - Des Ford

Grace Brings Us Joy
===================
*The joy of the Lord is your strength.* - Nehemiah 8:10 KJV

Christ told many stories about parties. He told only one, a mini-parable, about a funeral (Matthew 11:17). Similarly, the Old Testament ordered many feasts, but only one fast. That was the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16:29–31).

Because “the joy of the Lord” is our strength, anyone who understands grace can only be joyous and strong. The word "joy" is prominent in the narratives of early Christianity (Luke 1:44,47; 2:10; 24:52; Acts 8:8).

When we remember the last hours of Jesus, we do not find him speaking in funereal tones about negative matters. We find him constantly reassuring his disciples that soon they would have his joy and peace (John 14:27; 15:11; 16:33).

Christ is no thoughtless optimist. He knows full well that there will be strife and pain for his followers. But remember how balanced and comforting his words are. "In this world you will have trouble." But "in me you may have peace'" (John 16:33).

Similarly, Jesus promises us multiples of good things, but adds “and with them persecutions” (Mark 10:29–30). He was – and is – a realist. He and his disciples could sing a hymn even as he set out on his way to the Cross (Matthew 26:30).

Nestling in Jesus’ realism is joy. Because of grace. – Des Ford

Christ our Salvation
********************


Our Saviour
===========
*What shall we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us, who can ever be against us?  Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, won’t he also give us everything else?* - Romans 8:31-32

Many unhappy Christians look upon Christ, first, as their example. Only second do they look upon him as their Saviour. That is upending things, turning them on their head. Which of us is like Jesus?

Jesus loved his enemies and prayed for them even on the cross. Jesus was always gentle, always tender, always understanding, always pure, always true, always God-centred, never selfish. If he is first of all my example, I am of all people most miserable because I am not like Jesus! I want to be like Jesus. It is my dearest desire. But I am a million light years from him.

But! If Jesus is first my Saviour – I have hope! The Saviour came into the world to save sinners. I qualify! That’s why he came. To save sinners like me and you.

The New Testament does not primarily portray Jesus as our example. If that were his task, he would have lived until he was an old man. Where is Jesus an example for anyone over 33? If he were only an example, he would have had to be a man and a woman. Women cope with some things men don’t. Men cope with other things women don’t. Jesus, to be an example for both, would have to be both. He wasn’t.

Because Jesus came first and foremost to be our Saviour, we can rest assured in Him if only we accept him in faith. – Des Ford, Romans 8:27-32, adapted from “The Crises of Christ: His Birth”

Our Representative
==================
*We are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died* - 2 Corinthians 5:14

When our Lord Jesus Christ was baptised, he was baptised for the whole world. He confessed for the whole world. He was penitent for the whole world. Everything our Lord did was representative. There is not a private act of Christ’s in the book. Everything he did has an infinite significance and an infinite depth. The essence of the gospel is that it represents him as representing the world.

God dealt with us on the basis of representation.

Adam represented the human race. If Adam had been a victorious overcomer, so would all his successors have been. His children, his grandchildren. You and I would have been, because he represented us.

But Adam failed. He threw us all into the Jordan. We were ruined on the principle of representation.

Through Jesus, we are saved on the principle of representation.  Please note, 2 Corinthians 5:14 does not say, ‘If one died for all, everybody need not die.’ If it was only the principle of substitution, that is what it would say.

Never forget. You died on the cross of Calvary in your representative, Jesus. – Des Ford

What Kept Jesus on the Cross
============================
*Let Christ, the king of Israel come down from the cross, that we may see and believe.* - Mark 15:32

When we combine the testimony of all the Gospels, we discover that Christ was not only mocked by the passersby and the mob around the cross, but by the chief priests, the elders, the scribes, the Pharisees, the soldiers and the thieves.

“He saved others, himself he cannot save.” Such was a major sneer in the mocking of the bystanders. They imitate the words of him who had earlier tempted Christ by saying, “If you're the Son of God, cast yourself down.” “If you're the king of the Jews, save yourself” echoed the suffering thieves before one of them surrendered to Incarnate Love beside him.

Here, as always, the devil overreached himself. The words meant to shame Christ actually glorify him. He was not on the cross because he could not come down, but because he would not. The bonds of love, not the nails of men, kept him there. It was strictly true that if he was indeed to save others then he could not, must not, save himself.

“He that destroys the temple, and in three days buildest it, save yourself.” This also was prophetic in a way undreamed of. He would in love permit the tabernacle of his body to be taken down, but within three days it would be rebuilt. Thus, we find in the mockery, statements both radically false and in another sense sublimely true.

What Jesus did, he did out of his perfect love. Will you accept his perfect love today? – Des Ford

Jesus Will Not Give You Up
==========================
*…his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.* – Lamentations 3:22

The story of the Last Supper, recorded in John 13 begins with the Lord washing the feet of the Twelve, not the eleven.

If I'd been in charge, it would have only been eleven. I wouldn't have washed Judas’ feet, knowing what he was about to do.

As the tide continually surges onto the beach, so the love of Christ repeatedly comes against the heart of the sinner. Christ even washes the feet of the man who is going to sell him for thirty pieces of silver.

If Christ could wash the feet of Judas, if the tide of his redeeming love could beat against that hard heart again and again, will he ever give us up because of our failures and our follies, however weak we may be?

Judas thought he was strong, however, the more we know about ourselves, the weaker we know ourselves to be.
 
If Christ could plead with someone so set on evil as Judas, the traitor of the Twelve, is he going to give us up? Surely, if Christ can love like that, then his compassion will not fail for us who are weak, often foolish, and too often straying. – Des Ford

You Can Trust a Weeping Saviour
===============================
*When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were confused and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.* - Matthew 9:16, NLB
 
Only twice in the Gospels are we told that Jesus wept. During his sufferings there is no record of a groan or a single trickling tear. All his laments are for others—for us.
 
We are told, in relation to his final journey to Jerusalem, that:

   *As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it* – Luke 19:41
 
As the procession reached the brow of the hill, and Jerusalem and its temple came into view, the King, instead of exulting, wept. What a scene!
 
Possibly it was the blind he had healed who led the procession. Perhaps it was the dumb to whom he had given voice, who proclaimed the loudest hosannas. Maybe the cleansed lepers laid their unstained garments in his path. It has even been suggested that Lazarus himself led the donkey on which Christ rode.
 
But, right at the time when the carping leaders demand that he silence the cheering crowds, Christ breaks into loud cries of grief and utters words of sorrow.
 
Here Christ shows us the heart of God and the essence of his gospel—love for the lost. We can trust a weeping Saviour. His tears should banish our fears. Soon his whole body will be enveloped in a bloody sweat because of the weight of our sins upon him. This is the only weeping God known to man. He is the only wounded deity. – Des Ford

Retractions
===========
*The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand  forever.* - Isaiah 40:8

The wise will change their minds, but fools never do.

Augustine wrote a book in his old age called Retractions. I could write one with that title too. The wise will change their minds, but fools never do. The reason some people won't write a book of retractions is because they are fools.

You see, truth is a testing thing, and to open your mouth is a dangerous venture. Now consider the claims of Christ.

On another occasion a woman anointed Jesus' head. He said,

    *"I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her"* - Mark 14:9, NIV

The Apostle John illustrates the universality of this statement when he says,

    "And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume" - John 12:3
    
This symbolizes that when the beautiful gift of God's love should be broken on Calvary, the fragrance would fill the universe as the fragrance and aroma of that jar filled the house.

How did Jesus know that "What this woman has done will go out with the gospel like a fragrance to the whole world"? How did he know? No one else has ever been able to see the future like this.

I love biographies. I've read hundreds of them. But there's no parallel to anything like this anywhere. – Des Ford

Words to Live By
================
*Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.* - Matthew 24:35

This is a prediction that could have come only from the lips of someone insane, or from — God! Consider the contrast: heaven and earth versus sounds thrown into the air. The most permanent is to be dissolved, and the most transitory will be perpetuated. This is the very opposite of what human wisdom would predict. And who said it? A peasant in little Palestine.

This was a peasant who had none of the things we use to perpetuate our words. He had no television, no radio and no printing press. Yet twenty centuries have been filled with those words of his.

We use his words at times of birth and death, amid sorrow and joy. They strengthen the weak and encourage the toiler. They give hope to the penitent sinner. Kings and princes, rulers of empires, and garbage collectors and street sweepers, scientists and physicians, university professors and newly arrived students, old and young, the living and the dying—all cherish them and live by them.

Christ’s words have no parallel in all of history. Men are influenced by Moses, by Paul and by the great figures of history, but none of these have been loved as Christ has been loved. Millions today would gladly die for him because they have found in him the key to life. – Des Ford

The Heart of the Matter
=======================
*“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”* - Matthew15:16

When you are discussing the truthfulness of Christianity, never center on secondaries. Go to the heart of the matter, the issue of Christ: Who was Christ?

The uniqueness of Christianity is that it is centered in One who claimed to be God incarnate, God in human flesh.

That idea is not found anywhere else. Confucius did not even talk about religion, much less claim to be divine! Confucius was a moralist not a religionist. He talked about family and behavior in business. He never thought of claiming even to be a prophet, or God on earth.  

Buddha was a philanthropist. He never claimed to be God.

Mohammed wanted to honor God too much to make such a claim.

To claim to be God is a good basis for putting someone away. C.S. Lewis was right: Any ordinary person who claims to be God is on a level with a person who thinks he's a poached egg!

So here is the distinctive thing about Christianity: its central Figure is Christ. Remember, Christianity is Christ and Christ is Christianity.

If you claim to be a Christian but your religion doesn't make you more like Jesus, you don't have the true religion. If my religion doesn't make me more like Jesus, I don't have true religion, either. – Des Ford

The Amazing Claims of Jesus
===========================
*These claims are valid even though I make them about myself. For I know where I came from and where I am going, but you don't know this about me.* - John 8:14, NLT

The New Testament states that when Jesus came, he claimed to be God (John 8:58, compare with Exodus 3:14). Jesus claimed that all the angels belonged to him. (Matthew 25:31 CEV). Imagine someone claiming to own the angels! Jesus also claimed that all nature was his. (Mark 4:39 NIV). The wind and waves obeyed him!

Jesus claimed to be the judge of people's thoughts and innermost motives, and he claimed to give rewards and penalties that would go beyond the grave (See Matthew 5-7). What merely human legislator ever did that?

Jesus pointed to the sun, and said: "I am the light of the world (John 8:12; 9:5). Imagine a Judaean peasant carpenter inviting the whole world to put all its burdens on his back and all its sorrows on his heart! (Matthew 11:28–30)

The amazing thing about these statements of Christ is that although they are so stupendous, they don’t knock us over. That's because of the kind of person he is, as presented in the Gospels. When you see what Jesus is like, his claims never bowl you over.

Though the words of Christ may have been spoken by a Judean peasant, but because of the kind of person he is, we accept his words. Christ’s claims are fitting, because of who he is. – Des Ford

The Miraculous Word of Jesus
============================
*Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through Him, as you yourselves know.* - Acts 2:22
 
The Gospel of John records seven miracles that Jesus performed. These illustrate the transforming power of Jesus in our lives.
 
In these miracles, we find transformation from sadness to gladness, from disease to health, from paralysis to abundant energy, from hunger to fullness, from anxiety to tranquillity, from darkness to light, from death to life. In these miracles, we are given a picture of the transformation that takes place in the life of every person who comes to Jesus. These miracles reveal that all things are under the control of Jesus.
 
The main point for each of us is that Christ’s transforming Word is as strong and efficient as His actual presence. Without touching the water in the stone jars at the wedding in Cana, Christ, with a word, turned it into wine. Later, He spoke a word at Cana and healed a boy at Capernaum. And that same word called a dead man from his grave. That word is still available to accomplish a miracle of salvation in the life of even the weakest of believers who calls out to Christ in faith. – Des Ford

Christ the Miracle Worker
=========================
*Jesus of Nazareth, a Man attested by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs.* - Acts 2:22, NKJV

Some Christians are embarrassed by the miracles of the New Testament. Instead, they should be thrilled!

The miracles that are recorded in the story of Jesus are integral to his story. You can't pull them out and leave the story behind.

For example, we are told that the raising of Lazarus became the occasion for the final meeting of the Sanhedrin to decree the death of Christ (see John 2, especially verses 45-53).

The controversies Jesus had with the religious authorities over the Sabbath only make sense in the light of his Sabbath miracles. Jesus healed one man in the synagogue on the Sabbath, healed another man of dropsy, and did other Sabbath-healing miracles. All this was in the context for his question, “Is it right to save life or to kill on the Sabbath?” If you take the miracles out, the whole controversy collapses!

Christ's miracles are often a bell to summon us to the sermon. After Jesus multiplies the loaves and fishes, he then talks about himself as the Bread of life (see John 6). When he gives sight to the blind, he talks about himself as the Light of the world (See John 9). The miracles are a bell to the sermon.

You cannot separate the miracles from the story. They are always united. – Des Ford

Jesus Calms Your Storms
=======================
*What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey Him!* - Matthew 8:27

Jesus’ miracle stilling the storm on the Sea of Galilee (Matthew 8) is also a parable of spiritual events.

Into every life, storms and havoc intrude, threatening to undo us. Usually we battle with the storms as though we were on our own, forgetting that there is One who can help us. But if we call upon Him, He will answer wonderfully.

Observe the power of the Word of Christ. By it He created heaven and earth, cast out demons, calmed the sea and raised the dead. His Word was always with power, and if we cling to it, trust it, obey it, that same power will work for us, stilling every storm.

Usually the inward storm of fear, doubt and bewilderment is worse than the outward blast. But here again the Word of Christ is the answer. “For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love, and of self-discipline” (2 Timothy 1:7). - Des Ford

    *“Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the Word of Christ.”* - Romans 10:17

The Cross of Jesus ...
======================
... **can Guide Your Life**

*And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself.* - John 12:32, NASB

Jesus answers the question “How shall we live?” Only the principle of the Cross of Jesus can rightly guide our hearts, minds and wills. When we, like Jesus, consent to crucify our selfishness and sacrifice ourselves for others, we begin to truly live. There is no other way.
 
Your response to Jesus’ death for you will determine your destiny. If you accept his sacrifice on your behalf, you will be given immortality when Jesus returns. If you reject his sacrifice on your behalf, you will be denied eternal life on that day.
 
The Judgement that takes place when Jesus returns will not decide your destiny; you decide your own destiny when faced with the Cross. The Judgement that takes place when Jesus comes will bestow on you the destiny that you chose when you decided to accept or reject Jesus as your Lord and Saviour.
 
The Bible says:

    *“Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed.”* - John 3:18

Jesus Shows Us the Love of God
==============================
*This is how God showed His love among us: He sent His one and only Son into the world that we might live through Him.* - 1 John 4:9
 
Very close to the end of his public ministry, Jesus speaks sad words to the Jerusalem that has rejected him:

    *“I have often wanted to gather your people, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. But you wouldn’t let Me. And now your temple will be empty of my presence.”*

Surely this is the sweetest word of divine pity ever spoken over a corrupt religion. We may deserve his judgements, but we cannot stop his love. There is always love for us in one heart: his. He is always there to help us if we will seek him.
 
What a beautiful picture Jesus gives us at the end of Matthew 23! When there is danger, the chicks have the mother’s wing folded over them. They are perfectly safe, perfectly comfortable and perfectly happy. It is our privilege to be like them; and we can be, if we have a true picture of God. - Des Ford

He Loved Us First
=================
*To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and has made us kings and priests to His God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.* - Revelation 1:5–6, NKJV

I love the sequence of ideas here. God loved us while we were still in need of washing. God loved us and then he washed us. God didn't wash us clean and then love us. God didn't free us from bondage of idolatry and darkness, and then say "Okay, I can stand you now." He loved us first.

He loves us in our sins.

    *“This man receives sinners”* - Luke 15:2, KJV
    
If you can’t believe it, write it on the wall where you sleep – because it’s true. “This man receives sinners.” That’s the essence of the gospel. It’s the best sermon in the Bible, and it was preached by Pharisees!

The Pharisees meant it as a rebuke and a devastating criticism, but the Holy Spirit said, "That's great! We'll enshrine that forever in the Book. That's it! They've got it straight. This man receives sinners."

"Unto him that loved us." God loved us just as we are; in our bondage, our darkness, our sin and filth, he loved us. – Des Ford

Jesus Washes Away Your Sin
==========================
*Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.* - Psalm 51:2

At the Last Supper, Jesus washed his disciples’ feet, showing them the full extent of his love.
 
Even though Jesus knew that his disciples would shamefully abandon him in a few hours’ time, he did not give up loving them. Jesus got up from the table, removed his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. He then poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
 
What Jesus did here was an acted-out parable of his ministry. He got up from the festivity of heaven, removed his outer glory, wrapped himself in humanity, and bowed down to wash away the dirt of our daily walk.
 
To those who refuse to let Christ wash away their sin, He says,

    *“Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.”* - John 13:8

Jesus Gives You ...
===================
... **His Perfect Righteousness**

*God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.* - 2 Corinthians 5:21

Jesus gives his righteousness to us as a free gift in exchange for our sins (2 Corinthians 5:21). Jesus paid the price for our sins so that we would not have to. He died so that we could live.

To get into heaven, we need to be justified by God. Because we need 100 per cent righteousness to get eternal life, we must accept, by faith, the free gift of God’s righteousness from Jesus. Those who put their faith in their own righteousness will miss out, because anything less than 100 per cent righteousness is a fail mark.

It’s not a matter of what we have, but whom we have. When Jesus comes into our hearts with his perfect righteousness, He will endeavour to live his life through us, making us more and more righteous every day. This righteousness won’t save us, but it shows that we have been saved. We don’t have to be good to be saved, but we do have to be saved to be good.  - Des Ford

Jesus Looks After You
=====================
*As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him; for He knows how we are formed, He remembers that we are dust.* - Psalm 103:13–14

John chapter 17 records the prayer that Jesus prayed as the shadow of is crucifixion fell upon Him. The amazing thing about this prayer is that Jesus is looking forward to the Cross as the place where he will be exalted, where the Father will be glorified, and where salvation will be provided for the world.
 
In this prayer, Jesus is setting himself apart for the sacrifice, during which he is both the officiating priest and the sacrificial lamb. He prays also for his followers. “They have obeyed Your Word”, He said to the Father (verse 6). These fallible, erring men were credited with Jesus’ own perfection. So it is with us.
 
When God looks at us, he sees us wrapped in the robe of righteousness that our Saviour has placed around us.
 
Christ prays that the Father will look after and keep all who put their faith in him. We can’t keep ourselves, but God’s hand on our shoulder is that of a loving brother. He will never let us go. We can never be lost while we cling to Jesus and seek to be like Him. - Des Ford

Jesus Took Your Sin ...
=======================
... **and Took Your Place**

*"Father, if you are willing, take this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done."* - Luke 22:42

In Gethsemane, Jesus confirmed his decision to take our place and die for us so we could live forever. He would go to the Cross, where he would suffer the second death in our place – a death that would be total and complete, with no hope of life beyond. No wonder it was such a difficult decision to make; no wonder he was so distressed.
 
God hates sin because of the harm it does to people, families and nations, so he has made plans to destroy it. But sin doesn’t exist outside of people. Because sin exists only in people, God can destroy it only in people. There are two ways he can do this. He can either transfer our sin to himself and then be destroyed with it in our place, or he can destroy sin by destroying us.
 
Because of Jesus’ love for you, he chose to be destroyed in your place. He would pay the full price for your sin upon the Cross.

    *God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.* - Romans 5:8

- Des Ford

Jesus Poured Out His Blood ...
==============================
... **For You**

*"This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."* - Matthew 26:28

In the story of Jesus’ trial, suffering and death, we read about his seven trials, the seven charges against him, the seven people who testified of his innocence, Pilate’s seven questions, and his seven statements that he found no wrong in Jesus. Jesus suffered seven unjust punishments during that long night.

The crucified Jesus had seven wounds, and his crucifixion period lasted seven hours, six hours on the Cross and the seventh being his time of rest when he was taken down. On the Cross, Jesus speaks seven times, and there are seven statements made to Jesus while he hung on the Cross.

These series of sevens are no coincidence. The Hebrew word sheba can be translated either ‘seven’ or ‘covenant’ (see Genesis 21:27–31). God made a covenant that he would save us from our sins and that, if we accepted his salvation, we would become his people.

On the Cross, Jesus shed his blood for our salvation. He was "the blood of the covenant", which would be poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever we drink this ‘blood’, we show that we accept Jesus as our Saviour. - Des Ford

Believe in Christ and Live
==========================
*I write this to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.* - 1 John 5:13, RSV

Yes, we may know how we stand with God. In fact there's one whole book of the Bible devoted to it – the first epistle of John. The Greek word for "know" occurs in this epistle forty times, and seventy times in the Gospel of John.

Don't think that eternal life is something future. Eternal life is ours the moment we believe and for as long as we believe. It refers to a quality of existence as well as to its duration. The New Testament certainly teaches that we can have assurance. "We know we have passed from death unto life," "We know we have eternal life," "we know we are of God."

To be human is to err but the Christian hates to err. He hates sin and fights it and flees from it. But even when a Christian does his best, he still must pray the Lord's Prayer, "Forgive us our trespasses." You must not let your assurance be shaken by your failures and mistakes.

If you've laid hold of Jesus as your Saviour, you have eternal life and know it. In the Gospel of John, every chapter except chapter two speaks of believing. Believing in Christ and knowing our salvation go together. – Des Ford

Christ Was Forsaken ...
=======================
... **That We Might Never Be**

*I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken.* - Psalm 37:25

Spurgeon says that the records of time and eternity do not contain a sentence more full of anguish than this fourth word from the cross:

    *“My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”* - Matthew 27:46 
    
Christ had endured silently all the torment of His body, but when His Father forsook Him, His great heart broke. As John Owen wrote, "The sufferings of His soul were the soul of His sufferings."

Christ does not cry, "Why has Peter forsaken Me?” or “Why has Judas betrayed Me?" These were terrible griefs, but feeling forsaken by His Father is the sharpest of griefs, and it cuts Him to the quick.

There are times when some of us face a horror that makes the brain reel and the heart faint. At such times, a glance at Calvary can steady us and perhaps even restore us. He was forsaken that we might never be. He prayed that prayer that we might never need to. We need not suffer for our sin, for Christ has suffered in our place. Therefore, however overwhelming our grief and bewilderment, let us like Christ hold on, crying, "My God, My God ... "

Nightmares never last. Tunnels have their exits. Only those who live through the dark see the glories of the dawn. – Des Ford

Jesus Was Rejected ...
======================
... **So That You Would Be Accepted**

*God ... chose to bring many children into glory. And it was only right that He should make Jesus, through His suffering, a perfect leader, fit to bring them into their salvation.* - Hebrews 2:10, NLT

    *“My God, My God, why have You deserted Me?”*

In this anguished cry from the Cross, we find the reason for Christ’s death. The records of time and eternity do not contain a sentence that is more full of anguish. It is not death that is the ultimate penalty for sin – it is separation from God. When God, who is the source of life, hope, joy and peace, abandons someone, all life, hope, joy and peace depart with him. And that is hell. Apart from God, there is no future at all, only a black hole of total extinction.
 
Christ, who bore the sin of the world, had to experience this separation. God intended to annihilate sin forever, and so Christ, who carried our sin, was being annihilated with it. Either Christ is destroyed with our sin, or we will be. There is no alternative.
 
Jesus was rejected so that we will be accepted. God separated himself from Jesus so that he might become one with us. That is the sacrifice that our Lord made for us. He gave up everything so that we might inherit everything. - Des Ford

Choose Jesus Over Barabbas
==========================
*He himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; “by His wounds you have been healed.”* - 1 Peter 2:24

The crowd shouted that Pilate should release Barabbas and crucify Jesus. This choice was made because people yielded to human pressure rather than to truth and righteousness. The crowd yielded to the chief priests, and Pilate yielded to the crowd. No one yielded to God.
 
In every decision we make, we too are making this choice. In the things we do, the ambitions we cherish, we choose either Barabbas or Christ. There are no fence sitters, no neutrals. “The one who is not with me,” said Jesus, “is against me.”
 
Here is the heart of the gospel. You and I are Barabbas – children of our earthly father. We are condemned to die because we have turned our backs on our heavenly Father. But an innocent One has chosen to take our place and die for us. He will suffer, he will agonise, he will ensure that we might be set free. Christ goes naked to the Cross, so that we might be clothed in his spotless robe of righteousness. Christ wears a crown of thorns that we might have a crown of glory. His body was bruised and pierced that ours might be glorified. - Des Ford

Salvation is ...
================
... **as Simple As A–B–C √**

*“What must I do to be saved?” ... “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.”* - Acts 16:30–31

We want forgiveness of sin. Many people are sick because they are guilty. They are sick because of things they have done. They need to learn about the Cross. At the Cross the done has been undone!

Many can't sing and can't rejoice, because they feel bad about what they have done, about how they have treated loved ones, or ones they should have loved. But the gospel takes away guilt.

    *People will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy."* - Matthew 12:31 NRSV
    
    *"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins, and purify us from all unrighteousness."* - 1 John 1:9
    
    *"Whoever comes to me I will never drive away."* - John 6:37
    
How wonderful!

Salvation is so simple. Just A-B-C:

    A is for "**All have sinned**" - Romans 3:23
    
    B is for "**Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved**" - Acts 16:31
    
    C is for "**If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.**" - Romans 10:9
    
A-B-C. It's as simple as that. – Des Ford

Jesus is the Good Samaritan
===========================
*A Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine.* Luke - 10:33–34, NIV

In the Parable of the Good Samaritan, it is the Samaritan who stops to help and minister to the dying man. Remember, in Luke's previous chapter, the Samaritan village would not receive Jesus. Now, in His story, Jesus is receiving the Samaritans. He makes a Samaritan the hero of His parable.

We never read Scripture aright unless we find Jesus there, and ourselves there also.

The wounded traveller was religious like us, but he was still beaten. He was left half-dead. That's all of us. Humanity started off well from Jerusalem, or Eden, but we were beaten up by the devil. He took our clothes and left us for dead.

That’s us. We’ve been stripped and we've lost our righteousness. But Jesus came near to where we are. He took our true humanity. God does not just shout from Sinai. God comes near where we are, like this beaten Samaritan. God puts his arms around us and provides for us. God brings us to the church to look after us. He says, “When I come back, l will balance all things out aright.” He is coming back for us.

What the Samaritan does is a picture of what Jesus does. He does what the priest and Levites can't do. 

You see, religion is not enough, unless it's about Jesus. – Desmond Ford

Jesus Died ...
==============
... **at the Place of the Skull**

*Christ is the Head of the church, His body, of which He is the Saviour.* - Ephesians 5:23

At Golgotha (“place of the skull”) our Lord was publicly treated as refuse. The Latin name of the place was “Calvary,” and it means the same thing. Probably the site got its name from the skulls and dead bones that remained there after the former crucifixions. At this site, death appeared in the most disgusting shape. Only the most abject of all men ended their days on Golgotha. Thus Christ became for us “a worm and not a man” (Psalm 22:6).

A skull is an empty head, and Christianity is foolishness to them that perish, because the wicked cannot understand a love so intense as to consent to complete self-emptying. But for the believer, Golgotha represents the wisdom of God, where the Head of the church gave Himself for all. It should remind us that not only by creation, but also by redemption, “the head of every man is Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:3).

The place of execution is further described as being “outside the gate” (Hebrews 13:12). Beyond the city was the place for lepers and garbage. Here Christ went for our sakes to the place of shame, rejection and pain. Christ suffered “outside the gate.” – Desmond Ford

The Wounds of Jesus Bring Peace
===============================
*Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” After He said this, He showed them His hands and side.* - John 20:19–20

Please note the meaning of Jesus’ first words to His disciples after His resurrection.
His first word, "Peace," reminds us of the many "fear nots" of the gospel. At the birth of Jesus, the angels come to the shepherds and say, "Fear not, we bring you good tidings of great joy that will be to all people." When the disciples are on the sea in the storm, Jesus appears and says, "Fear not." When the stone is rolled away from the tomb, the angel's words are, "Fear not, He is not here for He is risen."

There are three hundred and sixty-five "fear not"s in Holy Writ, one for every day of the year. When he says, "Peace," he's saying the same thing.

Please notice the grounds on which Jesus can say to these guilty men and women, like you and me, "Peace be unto you." The answer is, "He showed them His hands and His feet.'' In the wounds of Jesus Christ and there only can peace be found: In the awareness that all our sins have been paid for – in the assurance that all guilt has been wiped out for those who believe, because He has endured all that the broken law calls for.

There is only one place of peace, and that's in the wounds of Jesus. – Des Ford

Jesus: the Heart of Christianity
================================
*Heaven and earth will pass away, but my Words will never pass away.* - Matthew 24:35

Christ is the only person who ever lived who claimed to be God, and yet was considered sane by the best of His generation. His influence was greater than all other teachers.
 
What other teacher ever dared to forecast that His teachings would last forever? Jesus declared:

    *“Heaven and earth will pass away, but my Words will never pass away.”* - Matthew 24:35

... and every day brings fresh proof of the truth of this. Each new generation finds in Jesus’ teaching what is new, fresh and inspiring. As we look across the centuries, we see how His Words have passed into laws, into church doctrines, into proverbs, and into words of comfort and support, but they have never passed away.
 
Jesus said:

    *“I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.”* - John 12:32

This claim shows that the inner life and the unifying factor of Christianity would be a person, not a philosophy, and that person is the carpenter of Nazareth. Usually in institutions and religion, we find at the core a set of beliefs, not a person. 

The heart of Christianity is not a creed, but a person – Jesus Christ. – Des Ford

Jesus is Your King
==================
*He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with Him are the called and chosen and faithful.* - Revelation 17:14
 
At one point in Jesus’ trial, the leaders of Israel took him to Herod’s palace where the Roman Governor, Pilate was staying. They did not understand that by handing Jesus over to unbelievers, they, as a nation, were rejecting their Messiah and were offering him to the Gentiles.
 
Pilate came out to meet the Jewish delegation that had brought Jesus and asked, “What charges are you bringing against this man?”
 
They evaded his question by answering, “If he were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.”
 
Pilate asked his soldiers to bring him the prisoner. When Jesus was standing before him, he asked, “Are you king of the Jews?”
 
Jesus admitted that he was guilty of the charge, but in such a way that he was innocent. How can that be? It’s because his kingdom is not of this world. If it were of this world, his servants would fight. Christ’s kingdom is a spiritual kingdom in the hearts of people, a kingdom that would one day have citizens from every nation on Earth.

Yes, Jesus was King of kings and Lord of lords. - Des Ford

Jesus is God’s Unspeakable Gift
===============================
*Thank God for his Son — his Gift too wonderful for words.* - 2 Corinthians 9:15, TLB

A great king gave all his citizens an invitation to a royal banquet at the palace. For admission, the guests had to bring what they thought was the fairest flower that ever bloomed. The citizens thronged to the palace, but were turned away by the thousands. Only a few found entrance. Many brought the deadly nightshade of superstition. Others arrived flaunting poppies of denominational pride. Still others brought the hemlock of self-righteousness.
 
The few who were allowed in had chosen the Lily of the Valley, the Rose of Sharon, the blood-red Rose of Calvary. Jesus is the price of heaven and nothing else is acceptable to God.

Jesus is God's "unspeakable gift" (2 Corinthians 9:15 KJV). Though he was rich, for our sakes he became poor, that through his poverty we might become rich. The Christian's chief duty is adoration. Faith does not make us see Christ. Seeing Christ gives us faith.

Repentance is not something to do in order to take hold of the Saviour. Taking hold of the Saviour gives us repentance. He is all we need.

Let us make the best choice and sit at the Master's feet, keeping our eyes on him, hearing him, loving him, and then spontaneously obeying and serving him. Let us consider, anew, God's unspeakable Gift: the incomparable Christ. – Des Ford

Christ Is Our Peace
===================
*As one man's trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one man's act of righteousness leads to acquittal and life for all men.* - Romans 5:18, RSV

Humanity's need for meaning, guidance, forgiveness, and moral strength are provided for in the Christian Gospel, and nowhere else. Because of this, we should all make the Gospel first in our thinking and doing. Paul saw this and wrote:


    *Now I would remind you, brethren, in what terms I preached to you the gospel ... For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures.* 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 RSV

How few, even of professing Christians, understand the words of Romans 5:10,18! These verses clearly state that the atonement of Christ restored the whole human race to favour with God. Christ is our peace, because he broke down the wall between God and humanity. By his own blood Christ signed the ransom papers for the race. And the Gospel is the glad word of that event.

Calvary is the “double cure” for sin. It takes away both sin's guilt and its power. Looking at the Cross, the believer sees the holiness of God, and repents; sees the power of God, and believes; sees the love of God, and is born again. – Des Ford

The Story of Jesus ...
======================
... **is the Story of the Church**

*“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”* - Revelation 1:8, NIV

I wonder if you’ve noticed that the book of Revelation couches the experience of the church in terms that remind us about Jesus. It is magnificent to see how whatever the Bible is writing about, somehow it always directs us to Jesus.

The “anti-Christ” is described as a duplicate, a counterfeit, of Christ. This is because false religion is always near the truth; the one thing it lacks is the blood – confidence and trust in the blood of Christ.

But then we look at the story of the true church. It also is expressed in terms reminiscent of Jesus. Did you notice here what it said? The church would prophesy – that is, uphold the truths of the Old and New Testaments – for 1260 days. That’s how long Jesus preached for when he was here on earth. The story of our Lord Jesus Christ is the story of his church.

The scenes of the judgments of Christ, the unfairness, the false witnessing, the lying and deception – all these will take place in every part of the world. It will be a time of trouble indeed. And my main question is, How do we prepare for it? How did Christ prepare for it? Trust and obey, for there’s no other way! – Des Ford

Jesus is Always With You
========================
*I am with you always, even unto the end.* - Matthew 28:20 KJV

These were Jesus’ last words to his church on earth. You may know that in the Greek (and in Hebrew also), ‘I am’ is the expression for ‘God.’ It means the ever-living Yahweh (or Jehovah).
 
The literal translation of ‘I am with you always, even unto the end,’ is: ‘I with you am all the days unto the end.’ All the days: the bad days, good days, blue days, daze days, all days. Jesus is not only with us, he is around about us. ‘With you’ separates the ‘I’ and the ‘am.’ ‘I with you am.’ Jesus is round about us. That’s why the Psalmist writes:

    *Where can I go from your Spirit?*
    *Where can I flee from your presence?*
    *If I go up to the heavens, you are there;*
    *if I make my bed in the depths, you are there...*
    *even there your hand will guide me,*
    *your right hand will hold me fast.* Psalm 139:7-10 NIV).
 
I love Lamentations 3:57. Here, the prophet cries out in agony and pain, says,

    *You came near when I called, and you said, ‘Do not fear.”*

The message, ‘Fear not’, is found 365 times in the Bible. You need not be afraid any day because, I with you am. There’s the great message of Jesus and of all of Scripture. – Des Ford

Christ is the Foundation ...
============================
... **of the Church**

*I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church.* - Matthew 16:18, NIV

In response to Peter's answer, Jesus calls Peter a rock, and speaks of building the Christian church upon a rock (Matthew 16:17-19). Much has been made of this passage.

Peter is a great man, whom God used to open the church to Jews and gentiles. Every time the apostles are listed, Peter is always first, and Judas last. Peter is very important; but some have claimed too much for him.

The issue in the dialogue between Jesus and his disciples is not, "Who is Peter?" but rather, "Who is Jesus?"

When Peter gives his correct answer, Jesus tells him God revealed the answer to him. Then Jesus said, "Peter, your name means a stone or a rock. This truth that you have uttered about me being the Christ, is a rock foundation into which you and the other disciples are built. You are built upon me, the Cornerstone. The temple of the Christian church will rear up on that Cornerstone."

The very foundation of the Christian church is the truth about Christ. If Christ is merely human, then Christianity is only a philosophy. If Christ is only human, he was but a martyr on the cross, not a Saviour. If he was a sinner, too, as you and I are, he cannot forgive our sins. – Des Ford

Jesus is Our Saviour
====================
*“Who is this man?” they asked each other. “Even the wind and waves obey him!”* - Mark 4:41, NLT

Who is this man Jesus that we should believe in him? The Man of the Cross is the true Adam, the true Moses, the true prophet, priest, and king. Everything in the Old Testament was written for him.
 
    * Christ is Adam, the head of the race, the image of God, the representative of all humanity.
    * He is Noah who builds a refuge from the wrath of God and thus saves his family.
    * He is Isaac, the beloved child of promise, miraculously born.
    * He is Joseph, the most beloved son, who, for pieces of silver, is betrayed by his brothers to the Gentiles, and saves millions with the bread of life.
    * He is Moses the deliverer who left the palace to redeem his people.
    * He is our Joshua, leading his people into the Promised Land.
    * He is our David, the warrior whose name means “beloved,” who was born in Bethlehem, and who never lost a battle when leading God’s people.
    * He is our Solomon, who builds the temple – the church of God.
 
Who is this man? **He is Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, the Almighty, the Alpha and Omega.**

Scripture gives him over 208 titles. Every one of them is sufficient to provide day upon day upon day of meditation – bringing glory, insight, wisdom, and hope.
 
Who is this Man? He is our Saviour. – Des Ford

Jesus is the Good Shepherd
==========================
*I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.* - John 10:11, NIV

Seven individual shepherds are mentioned in the Bible. These seven shepherds are Abel, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, David, Christ, and ''the idol shepherd'' of Zechariah 11:16, 17 – a reference to the Antichrist. The other six shepherds are often seen as types of Christ, the Good Shepherd.

We learn of the tragic fate of the Messiah Shepherd from Abel who was murdered by his brother. Christ's loving care for the lost sheep is prefigured in the life of Jacob (see Genesis 30:31; 31:28-40).

The abundance of bread ("enough and to spare" Luke 15:17) is pictured in the life of Joseph (Genesis 37:2).

It is written of Moses, the fourth shepherd, that he watered, protected and guided the sheep (See also Hebrews 3:2–6).

As for David, the fifth individual shepherd presented in the Old Testament, he stands out as a beacon because he gladly risked his life for his sheep (see 1 Samuel 17:34-36).

The good shepherds of the Bible all prefigure the One to be born who would not only be the sacrificial Lamb, but also the ultimate Good Shepherd. Jesus said that he was the door to the sheepfold (John 10:7). If anyone enters by that door and nestles in the arms of that Shepherd, he will carry him back to the fold of God. – Des Ford

The Gospel Writers ...
======================
... **Tell Us of Jesus**

*It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead… Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.* - Acts 4:10,12, NIV

We confess with Matthew that Jesus is the Christ, the son of David and Abraham, the Son of God, who is Immanuel (God with us), and that he fulfilled the law and the prophets and inaugurated the ultimate Kingdom of Heaven. As the perfectly obedient Messiah, Jesus made final atonement for sin by his death on the Cross.

We confess with Mark that Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, the Son of God who was also the suffering Son of man, came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. By his ministry, death, and resurrection, he inaugurated the kingdom of God and will, as Lord of history, soon bring about its consummation.

We acknowledge with the writer of Luke and Acts that Christianity is a universal faith, embracing all without distinction, making them one in Jesus Christ. It is a faith that in love lifts the outcasts and underprivileged, assuring them of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of humankind.

We affirm with John that the Word, who was God and with God in the beginning, became flesh and dwelt among us. We confess him to be the one who took away the sin of the world. That is how whoever believes in him will not perish but experience eternal life now. – Des Ford

All the Bible is about Jesus
============================

*Then he said, “When I was with you before, I told you that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms must be fulfilled.”* - Luke 24:44

The whole Bible, both Old and New Testaments, enshrines Christ. Its chief characters, institutions, and histories, prefigured him. He is a true prophet, priest, and king. He was God's living temple. He was the incarnate Shekinah glory. He was the ladder let down from heaven. He was the true manna, as well as the uplifted serpent and the water from the rock.

Hundreds of prophecies in the Old Testament find their complete fulfilment in Christ (e.g. Isaiah 53, Psalm 22, Micah 5:2). From the very beginning, the Bible paves the way for Jesus. In Genesis we find the Messiah would be the seed of the woman, and then a descendant of Shem, and then of the seed of Abraham and finally the tribe of Judah.

Haggai said he would come in the days of the second temple. Daniel declared that it would be at the end of seventy weeks of years following the temple restoration decrees given by heathen monarchs. Micah said Messiah would come from the little village of Bethlehem.

How much evidence do people need? Has not God given more than enough for every honest seeker? – Des Ford

Victors Over Temptation
=======================
*Get out of here, Satan,” Jesus told him. “For the Scriptures say, "You must worship the Lord your God and serve only him." Then the devil went away, and angels came and took care of Jesus.* - Matthew 4:10

Christ’s temptation was not our temptation. The devil tempted Jesus about our Lord’s mission. We are never tempted to turn stones into bread, to jump down from temple pinnacles, to receive the kingdoms of the world. We are not Saviours of the world.

The First Adam was challenged by the devil. The Last Adam challenged the devil. (Jesus, you’ll remember, was driven into the desert by the Holy Spirit.)

When the First Adam lost out, he involved the whole world in his ruin. When the Last Adam won, he involved the whole world in his victory. We don’t have to surrender to temptation. By believing in Christ, we can be the victor over every conscious temptation that comes to us. As we exercise faith, the victory is already ours!

It’s wonderful to know Christ has defeated the devil. Looking to Christ we can be victors over temptation. – Des Ford

No Need to be Afraid
====================
*I am with you always, even unto the end.* - Matthew 28:20

Literally, ‘I am with you always, even unto the end,’ is ‘I with you am all the days unto the end.’ All the days: the bad days, good days, blue days, daze days, all days. Jesus is not only with us, he is round about us. ‘With’ separates the ‘I’ and the ‘am.’ ‘I with you am.’ Jesus is round about us:

    Where can I go from your Spirit? 
    Where can I flee from your presence? 
    If I go up to the heavens, you are there; 
    If I make my bed in the depths, you are there.
    
    If I rise on the wings of the dawn, 
    if I settle on the far side of the sea, 
    even there your hand will guide me 
    your right hand will hold me fast. - Psalm 139:7-10, NIV

The message, ‘Fear not’, is found 365 times in the Bible. You need not be afraid any day because, I with you am. There’s the great message of Scripture and of Jesus. – Des Ford

In the World, Trouble ...
=========================
... **in Christ, Peace**

*Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me.* - John 14:1, NASB

The word "believe" is found approximately 100 times in this single book, the Gospel of John. Almost every one of the 21 chapters of John has the word "believe."

"Let not your hearts be troubled." It's true that there is cancer. It's true there is death on the highway. It's true there is tragedy in the home. But Christ says, "Let not your hearts be troubled." Instead, believe.

Jesus says it in the imperative, and that's the way modern translations often render it: "Believe in God, believe also in me" (RSV). It is a command, because it is the only way we can have peace.

Our hearts will be troubled and they will be afraid if we let them. But if we look at what we have in Christ, our hearts need not be troubled even in this trouble-filled world. Jesus explains why:

   *I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world* - John 16:33
 
While we are in the world, we will always have trouble. But Christ has overcome the world, and when we trust in his victory, we can have peace. In the world, trouble. In Christ, peace. – Des Ford

What The Animals Teach Us
=========================
Natural revelation shows the reasonableness of believing in a Creator. The Bible commands us to: 

    *Ask the animals, and they will teach you* – Job 12:7

In Australia, we have a kind of cicada that stays underground for 17 years. One day you're walking through the bush and you hear a horrible clatter and racket! You know the cicadas have come up, but this is the crop from those that went down 17 years ago. After 17 years they've come up to fill the bush with a cacophony of life and vitality... after being buried for 17 years!

Who doesn't know about the life of a caterpillar? At the prime of its life, it goes into its chrysalis tomb. A child stumbling upon that wrapped, apparently lifeless, form would say, "That's the end of that."

But despite appearances, it's not the end. The time will unfailingly come when that chrysalis will open, and out of that tomb will come something beautiful. And that butterfly will do something it could never do before – fly! Before, it was earth-bound, as we are. One day we will travel at the speed of thought. One day we will be transformed, just like the butterfly. – Des Ford

God Is In This Place
====================
*Surely the Lord is in this place… This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven* - Genesis 28:16–17

The omnipresence of God doesn't mean that God is spread out thinly, as though there's a little slim sliver of divinity here, there and everywhere. The omnipresence of God means that God is fully present in every place.

Jacob recognised the omnipresent God. Enoch so knew the omnipresent God that he walked with him, like Abraham, the friend of God, and like Moses, who talked to God face-to-face (Exodus 33:11).

My friends, our privileges are much greater than those of these Old Testament worthies. The Holy Spirit moved in Old Testament times, but not in the same degree and power as has been possible since Christ's atonement at Calvary.

When our Lord Jesus rose from the dead, he breathed upon his disciples and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (John 20:22). By so doing, he was saying, "Because of the cross, you need never walk alone. Because of the cross, I have brought the omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient God to dwell alongside you, and inside you, now and forever.”

So now you can say this about your kitchen, your bedroom, your workshop, your office, and your car: "Surely the Lord is in this place!" You may be anxious or distressed, thinking that you are alone. No! Wherever you are, remember that God is in this place. – Des Ford

You Can Get Through Suffering
=============================
*The God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.* - 1 Peter 5:10

Christ could stand the terrible pain because He knew God was there. He rested in the fatherhood of God. It is true that at one stage the agony of the guilt of the world was so terrible that He cried out, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"

Think on some of the events that happened at the Cross. Jesus was like a guilty prisoner at the bar. He had our sin upon Him as He bore the guilt of all the world. He was suffering an infinite amount of pain. In those six hours, He experienced what was due to everybody ever born.

Jesus suffered the agony of separation from God. Jesus endured hell qualitatively; an infinite being suffering infinite pain to atone for the sin of the world.

It is not wrong to ask, "Why?" Jesus cried, "Why?" And there will be times when we will ask the same question. But we must move on to, “Father, into your hands I commit my life.” If we can say, “My God,” in the midst of our pain, we will survive. If we can take hold of the God that seems to be thrusting us away we will survive.

When we bring God into our darkest depths, it brings light upon us. – Desmond Ford

Christ Overcame Evil With Good
==============================
*Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.* - Romans 12:21

We find our best lesson on tragedy in the Cross of Christ. The Cross itself is a symbol of pain, limitation, strain, hatred and rejection. Think of all the worst things involved in tragedy; they are all there at the Cross. Jesus is poised between heaven and earth to indicate He's rejected by both, but His arms are outstretched to indicate that He will continue to love us. What a lesson about pain and tragedy! Even when you feel forsaken by God, stretch out your arms with love. Overcome evil with good.

In the wilderness Jesus was tempted to use His divine power to escape the fierce assaults of Satan. According to Mark 15:30-32, the last temptation that came to Him on the Cross was likewise a temptation to use His power to escape the insults of the mob and His allotted sufferings: *“Save Yourself and come down from the Cross.”*

He could have come down and yet He couldn't have. He had the power to come down from the Cross. If He could move a finger He could have destroyed all His enemies. The bonds that kept Him there were the bonds of love, not the nails. If Christ had saved Himself, He couldn't have saved us. There at the Cross, Christ overcame evil with good. – Desmond Ford

Christ Gives Your Life Meaning
==============================
*I am the way and the truth and the life.* - John 14:6

Unless we are first clear as to the meaning of life, why we are here and where we are going, there is neither sense nor meaning for the sorrows of life. How you and I think of death makes all the difference to how we live. Only in Christ does human life find meaning. He did not idly say, 'I am ... the life' and 'I am ... the truth'. He is the truth about all things, including life and death. If we are to be raised from the dead as he was, we must live in the spirit that he lived.

But there’s more than that. All the gifts of this life are the result of Christ's Cross. It was his volunteering in Eden to take man's place, his guilt and punishment, which saved the race from extinction there and then. Thus, everything we know that is good  – life itself, food, drink, the air we breathe, the clothes we wear, our loved ones and friends – all are stamped with the cross of Calvary which bought them.

Therefore, we own nothing. We are but stewards of the gifts of his grace, and all should be used to his glory. To live as though we were our own, is to live and die as fools. – Des Ford

Choose The Right Thoughts
=========================
*The end of all things is near. Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray. Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.* - 1 Peter 4:7–8

Seeing life as a brief probationary period to prepare for the hereafter, places all things in right proportion. My eternal destiny and all I can influence should interest me more than all the temporary tinsel of human experience. Christ has suffered that we might have eternal happiness. Shall we be so demented as to neglect something so valuable?

When we cherish such reflections, they enable us to turn the kaleidoscope of thought aright. Against the backdrop of Calvary and eternity, everything in this life assumes a new shape. When the Cross is engraved in our hearts, beneath its shadow the pride, the vanity and folly of many of life's pursuits and values becomes apparent. Sensing that “out of the heart are the issues of life” and remembering His crown of thorns, our very imaginations will be dedicated to God.

When we do this, to crucify vain thoughts of pride, impurity, selfish ambition, irritability and complaint, takes priority among our concerns. In thinking uselessly and aimlessly time is lost, no less than in speaking that way. The account we shall render for each shall not be very different. It is certain that in choosing my thoughts, I choose my habits and my destiny. – Des Ford

When It Seems God Isn't There ...
=================================
... **He Is**

*I am glad for your sake that I was not there.* - John 11:15

Christ was glad because He had a bigger plan. He raised Lazarus from the dead to encourage all who would lose loved ones in death, and He gave encouragement to the bereaved of all ages.

Perhaps Christ is still saying, in some of the situations in our lives:

    *“For your sake, I am glad I was not there.”* - John 11:15

Perhaps He has a much bigger plan than the one we would thrust upon Him immediately.

This we know – our God does all things well. Our perspective is so cramped, and we see but dimly. God isn't always to be perceived just in light and glory. He's also in the darkness. According to Scripture, justice and righteousness are the foundation of His throne, but clouds and darkness are round about Him (Psalm 97:2). The stars shine brighter on the darkest nights.

The Bible tells us we are never alone in the darkness. There is One who holds our hand, a very present help in trouble.

We see darkly, we stumble, and we wander in our pain. But when we see our God – who loves supremely, who is there for us, and who cares – then we realise that tears are often the birth pangs of greatness. – Des Ford

God’s Kingdom ...
=================
... **Is A Kingdom of Freedom**

*Through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.* - Romans 8:2

The Apostle Paul’s Epistle to the Romans is a great letter about freedom. In the first five chapters, it talks of our freedom from the wrath of God. Then, in chapter six it talks about our freedom from the dominion of sin. In the seventh chapter, it is saying we are free from law as a covenant. It is no longer a method to be used to gain “brownie points” with God and to assure us of our righteousness. Then, in the following chapter, Paul says we are free from death.

Read the last verses of each of these chapters and we find in each case that the freedom is “through Jesus Christ our Lord”.

The chief cause of unhappiness is not from outside but from inside, from unsatisfied desires and passions. The only free person in the world is one who wants to do what he or she ought to do.

When we really come to believe that God loves us, and that He loved us enough to die for us in Christ, then everything changes. With that glorious faith, the Holy Spirit comes into the life and He writes the law of love in our hearts so that now we want to do what we ought to do. With Christ, there is perfect satisfaction and overwhelming joy. – Des Ford

Sin Does Not Rule In Your Life
==============================
*For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace.* - Romans 6:14

The Christian sees in every transgression the nail and the spear that pierced Christ. Indeed, nothing less than the revelation of the wickedness of the human heart and the love of the divine One as given by the Cross could break the fascination of evil for depraved humanity. The gospel certainly does not make light of sin.

But the way of conquest over sin is the way of indirection. The power of sin is annulled in experience as its guilt is taken away by faith in Christ's atonement. The Christian sees that his sins were crucified with the Saviour and nailed to his Cross. As we see our complete identity with our Representative, sin ceases to reign in us. But no sin is ever crucified either in heart or life until it is first pardoned in conscience. Here are the words of Paul:

We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? … For we know that our old self was crucified with Him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin… count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. (Romans 6:2,6,11). – Des Ford

Jesus Teaches You to Forgive
============================
*Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.* - Luke 23:34

“Father, forgive them.” We do not begin to live until we shut the door on the past through forgiveness. And no one lives properly until they have experienced forgiveness themselves. Fortunately, it’s not hard to know when we have received forgiveness ourselves. Just as you can’t give money to someone else until you have received it yourself, so you cannot give forgiveness to anyone else until you have received it yourself.
 
If you are unable to forgive someone who has sinned against you, it is because you haven’t received forgiveness yourself. And if you aren’t forgiven, then you aren’t saved (Matthew 6:14–15). Forgiveness is a bridge that we must all pass over to enter the kingdom of God.
 
Every relationship in life calls for forgiveness. There are no perfect wives, perfect husbands, or perfect children. There are no perfect employers or perfect employees. And there are no perfect friends or neighbours. For this reason, forgiveness must be the very essence of our relationships with others. It must be as natural as breathing. - Des Ford

We Grow Towards Perfection
==========================
*Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people. 19 For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.* - Romans 5:18

The apostle Paul, in Romans 5:18 and 2 Corinthians 5:14, shows us that when Christ died, it was reckoned as though the whole wicked world died. Henceforth our debts are paid.

But our cure experientially is not yet complete. Our way to the kingdom of God may be marked by stumbling, limping, and crawling upon the floor. A Christian of vast experience once wrote: "We ourselves are constantly falling, failing in speech and action to represent Christ; falling and rising again, despairing and hoping."

Our holiness is not purely ethical, though it seeks to be so, but rather, one that is manifested in an increasing humility and awareness of sinfulness. So the marks of sanctification are not the marks of legalistic achievement, but rather, increasing prayerfulness; increasing self-distrust, and increasing faith in him alone who can save and keep. If we do not manifest an increasing hatred for our sins, we have never been justified.

Romans 5:1–11 lists some of the aspects of the subjective experience of the believer. Now that justification has come, so has peace and joy and love for God. Patience is developed by the way one reacts to trial, trouble and tribulation. One grows towards that perfection with which the believer is initially and forever credited. Christ regards us as though the work is already complete. – Des Ford


.. image:: ../images/Flourish02.png

We Must Become ...
==================
... **What We Already Are**

*God ... raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.* - Ephesians 2:6, NKJV

We are already seated in heavenly places in Christ, having died with him, been buried with him and having risen with him. (See Galatians 2:20; Romans 6:4; and Colossians 3:1). The Christian is admonished to become what he already is; that is, because he is a child of the King, he is to act like one.

Therefore at every stage of his experience the Christian may know that he is fully accepted of God, despite his or her internal ups and downs of feelings, emotions, and ethical achievements or failures. Note that the second half of each Pauline Epistle stresses the “therefore” in the life of the justified. Justification without holiness is a heresy.

For practical Christian living, the challenge is to focus our attention on what Christ is to us, rather than what we are to him. We are not to make the mistake of reasoning from feeling to fact to faith, but the reverse. God’s love and acceptance of us is like the blazing sun, always complete and full and warm. But our attitude to God is like that of the waning moon, always incomplete, and always only a slight reflection of his own.

No one will ever perish while he or she depends upon the merits of Christ’s atonement. – Des Ford

As You Look To Jesus ...
========================
... **You Will Be Changed**

*Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith* - Hebrews 12:2, NKJV

The two doctrinal ills in the matter of salvation are legalism and antinomianism. The former teaches that we must be good in order to be saved. The latter teaches that being saved, we can do as we like. Both of these are erroneous. God accepts us just as we are. The legalism in the New Testament was not the belief that we are saved by works, but that we are saved by faith and works. In reality, we are saved by faith alone, though the faith that saves is never alone.

Neither does sanctification come by looking to self. There we find only insufficiency, inadequacy and sin. We are saved by looking to the Saviour. For every look at your wounds of sin, give ten looks to the Great Physician. Whatever gets our attention gets us. Whatever we hold in the mind passes into action.

If the Christian continually keeps his sin and failures and mistakes in his mind, he will sin and make more and more mistakes. But if Christ is pre-eminent in the Christian's thinking, then he will grow more and more like his Master, so that:

    *We all with open face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory.* - 2 Corinthians 3: 18

What Prayer Is
==============
*If you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him.* - Matthew 7:11, NLT

If there is a loving heavenly Father – and we need not doubt that until rocks rush to form a Taj Mahal or computers without fingers or electricity can churn out a Bible – he would want to talk to us. Because talking must always be a two-way street, all the great characters of the Bible were praying people. The prophets, Abraham, Elijah, Jeremiah, and others - Samuel, Hannah, Peter, and Paul - were all praying people. No wonder then that the Bible talks about prayer 350 times.

They knew what we must learn: that if we lived under the constant benediction of the supreme fact of the universe that God is love, our lives would be in constant peace.

What, then, is prayer?

Prayer is need finding a voice. It is slipping through an open door to find our best Friend in the universe. Prayer is telling God what upsets us, what concerns us. It's telling God when we're grateful for his help, when we need his guidance, when we want his forgiveness, when we've been stupid and fearful and anxious, and when we've messed everything up. Prayer is a little child going to the Father and spilling out the heart. – Des Ford

Prayer is the Key
=================
*Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.* - Matthew 7:7, 8

Prayer is a primary fact of life. The belief that God exists has persisted with the human race throughout history, so it is natural for us to pray. Prayer is an expression that we are not self-sufficient, and that we are asking God to help us.

Phillips Brooks, the great preacher who wrote, "0 Little Town of Bethlehem," saw a little boy standing on tiptoe, trying to press a buzzer outside the door of a house. Being a man of great benevolence, Phillips lifted the boy up so he could press the button. Then the boy cried, “Now scoot!” and wriggled out of his arms and scooted. Phillips Brooks was left standing at the door to explain.

Prayer is not pressing the doorbell, then scooting. Prayer is sharing with God. Prayer is listening as well as talking. Prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven's storehouse, wherein are stored all the treasures of omnipotence.

The optic nerve is very tiny, but because of it, we can see the sun and the moon and the stars, the faces of those we love, and all the wonders of the earth.

Prayer is the optic nerve of our spiritual nature. Why then, do some sever that nerve it if is to their great and eternal loss? – Des Ford

Be Careful With What You Desire
===============================
*Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.* - Psalm 37:4 NIV

The main hindrance to prayer are the things we value and desire, because every desire is a prayer.

In the parable of the prodigal son, “The younger son told his father, 'I want my share of your estate now before you die.” (Luke 15:12 NLT). He got it and landed in a famine. Lot got what he desired: Sodom – and he had to leave it with his tail between his legs. Judas got what he wanted: thirty pieces of silver – and he swung from a tree. Every desire is a prayer.

We must be careful with the things we desire, and with how we live. We can't pray well and live wickedly. We can't pray purposefully and live carelessly (See Isaiah 59:2).

It is because of our desires that we despise what is readily available. In St. Peters in Rome, there is a door into the cathedral that is only opened four times in a century. It is called the *porta sancta*. Just four times every one hundred years, the pope approaches the door with a small silver hammer and knocks on the door. Then it is opened to him.

Suppose you could pray only once every 25 years. How would you pray then? Of course, you are not restricted. But the fact that prayer is readily available makes us underestimate its value, and to desire other things. We should make God’s desires our desires. – Des Ford

Prayer Is Not ...
=================
... **Just Spending Time On Your Knees**

*Keep on praying...* - Romans 12:12, NLT

An objection to prayer that I encountered early in my life is that we think it means spending long hours on our knees. The great preacher, Spurgeon, said,

    "If that's what prayer is, I couldn't do it, even for the sake of eternity."

I remember as a young, inexperienced student, going to the most saintly man in the college community.

   "Brother Bohringer," I asked, "is prayer all about spending a long time on your knees?"

   "Oh, no, son," he answered. "Prayer is just talking to God, wherever you are, whatever you are doing. It's not just about being on your knees."

Of course, it is true that many of the great saints of history have spent long hours in prayer. But they were hours spent in meditation and the study of God's word, and in crying out. One disciple of Saint Francis of Assisi listened all night long to the great man. All the disciple heard was Francis saying every now and again, "My God and my all. My God and my all." That is a grand prayer.

Periods of prayer work both ways. We speak to God, God speaks to us, and we stop and think.

Prayer goes both ways. The person who is talking all the time never learns anything. That's wasteful. – Des Ford

Jesus Invites Us To Laugh
=========================
*God ... has anointed you with the oil of gladness.* - Hebrews 1:9, NKJV

We think of our Lord as a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and this is correct. We would never find comfort in a man who knew only laughter.

We're not told about the laughter of Jesus and yet the Bible does say that he was "anointed ... with the oil of gladness" (Hebrews 1:9). Think about the humour Jesus uses when he says thing like:

   *"Why do you see the sawdust in your neighbour's eye and not the log in your own?" "If the blind lead the blind, shall they not both fall into the ditch?" "They strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel."*

The only reason we do not laugh at such expressions is because we have a feeling that it would be irreverent. Either that, or we don’t really think about them sufficiently to appreciate the full picture Jesus was describing.

Human beings were intended to laugh. There is such a thing as the laugh of faith, rejoicing in the assurance that God is not only good, but more than good. He delights in our joy and has made provision that it should be a joy that will last forever.

Next time you enjoy a really good laugh, remember that it can also be a symbol of the bubbling joy of the gospel. – Des Ford

There’s Always Something ...
============================
... **To Be Thankful For**

*Give thanks in all circumstances.* - 1 Thessalonians 5:18

Two angels set out from heaven, each with a basket to bring back the prayers and thanksgiving of those on earth. The angel of thanksgiving started with a large hamper; the collector of petitions with a small basket. When they returned, each was in trouble. The petitions overflowed the small basket and filled a sack as well. But the bottom of the large hamper was not even covered by the three tiny thanksgivings!
 
We dare not despise the nine lepers who were cleansed and did not return to thank Jesus, for we often do the same. It has always been much easier for us to cry “give me” than to give thanks. One of our greatest needs, which if fulfilled will multiply our joy, is the need to think and to thank.

The trouble is, of course, this poor human nature of yours and mine. Our human nature is as crooked as a corkscrew. To say “thank you” is just as difficult for us as to practice giving rather than getting.

Watching the rain, one woman said, “It will settle the dust. Another woman said, “This will make mud.” Misery is simply a synonym for ingratitude. There is always something to be thankful for each day, even if it’s only for what hasn’t happened. – Des Ford

God Teaches You To Trust Him
============================
*The LORD ... guarded him as the apple of his eye, like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them.* - Deuteronomy 32:10,11 NIV

Our Heavenly Father in his great love uses all sorts of methods to teach us to trust in him, and distrust in ourselves. Keep in mind they always go together, and are the fruit of the moving of the Divine Spirit. One way that God endeavours to teach us to distrust ourselves and to trust in him is the medium of change.

We read in Deuteronomy 32:11, that as the eagle stirs up her nest and ejects her young, all the while capably and protectively hovering over them, so God stirs up our comfortable nests in order that we might learn to fly by faith in him.

When life is monotonously the same and there are few surprises, there often seems little need of divine help. But the most significant things that happen to us are not the ones planned or premeditated. They are the ones that come out of the blue like an angel, or a demon; like the glory of a rainbow, or a shaft of lightning.

Who is equal to these challenges? No one. Nobody has the strength, nor the wisdom, to successfully cope with all the emergencies of life. We need God and we need him every moment, and the wise person is the one who acknowledges that fact continually. This is faith. – Des Ford

Jesus Has The Answer ...
========================
... **For The Sadness of Life**

*The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever.* - Isaiah 40:8

When John Wesley was 87, just before giving one of his last sermons, the congregation was singing a beautiful hymn written by his brother Charles Wesley, and they came to the line where Jacob says, "My company before has gone, and I am left alone with Thee." As the elderly John Wesley thought of the loss of his brothers and sisters and his companions in the ministry, he was overwhelmed with emotion. The old preacher suddenly sat down and covered his face with his hands. But only for a moment. Then he stood up and finished the hymn with the congregation.

The ultimate sadness of life is that nothing lasts. The beauty, the strength, the youth doesn't last, and the vigour of mid-life is temporary. So people search madly for possessions, for pleasure, and for power. Subconsciously, we try one thing after another in our efforts to buy immortality.

Jesus gave us the remedy on his last earthly night with his disciples. He said,

    *"Because I live, you shall live also. For if a man love me, he'll keep my words. And I'll abide with him, and my Father will abide with him."* John 15

The joy of the Gospel is that God’s love outlasts everything else. – Des Ford

You Must “Trust and Obey”
=========================
*Lord Almighty, blessed is the one who trusts in you.* - Psalm 84:12 NIV

It's the difficult situations that make us into the type of people who have learned to trust and obey regardless of the circumstances. The Christian isn't promised a life free from pressures and anxieties. He is promised the assurance that God will not forsake him, because God will be with him amidst all of life's trials. The Christian is promised that ultimately he will see that all things have worked together for good, and that neither death, nor life, nor things present, nor things to come, nor anything can separate him from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. To be able to claim God as your Father is far, far better than to be the king of a great country or the wealthiest person in creation.

To have God as your Father, heaven as your home, eternal life in the present, forgiveness of sins, to walk in step with the universe: that's worth more than all the world's riches. When you believe this, life's trials diminish in significance.

There are those who call for an analysis of the cause and effect relationship behind the problem, in order prayerfully and carefully to make a decision, and then to act. That’s fine, however, as the old hymn says, "Trust and obey, for there's no other way." – Des Ford

Temptation is Not Sin
=====================
*The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand.* - 1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT

Oscar Wilde said, "I can resist everything except temptation." We have to do better than Oscar. God had one Son without sin, but he has never had one son or daughter without temptation.

It's very important to know the difference between temptation and sin. There are times when all genuine Christians feel terrible, soiled, besmirched, guilty, because they have fought a battle with sin. Even though they said, "No!" they feel bad about being tempted.

Friends, there is no condemnation in being tempted. There is only condemnation in saying, "Yes!" You may be tempted to lose your temper, to do something drastic, or do something impure. That's temptation, not sin.

Temptation is our daily companion. To a sensitive, alive, alert person, temptation is a constant associate.

With most of us, it's not the temptation to do something drastic. Our temptations are much more minor. Our temptations are things we think we can get away with. Most of us aren’t big-time murderers or big-time thieves. We can only get away with the little murders, the small unkindnesses.

You and I are so self-centred by nature, that although the whole world aches for kindness, we are tempted repeatedly to be selfish and unkind when we can get away with it. That is our greatest temptation. – Des Ford

Pain is a Teacher
=================
*Consider it pure joy ... whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.*  - James 1:2–3 NIV

Shadows compose half the beauty of the world, and in every human life it is the same. You never see a great painting without shadows. Malcolm Muggeridge said, "The only ultimate tragedy is to so settle down in this world that you feel at home in it." That is the only ultimate tragedy.

We can only learn to be patient and kind, forgiving and merciful if we endure pain. The best teacher is pain. In a rebellious world, there is only one way that the character of rebels can be changed and made wonderful and full of light: that is by pain. Without pain we would be destroyed, and be worthless. I guess that in our pain we remember that God is in control.

The fact that Christ could feel forsaken means that we need never feel forsaken. But the fact he felt forsaken did not mean he was. You and I often feel forsaken. This does not mean that we are forsaken, anymore than Christ feeling forsaken was evidence that he was.

Black Friday became Good Friday, and this is the greatest parable of all: that the things that hurt us most can ultimately help us be the best. To suffer is terrible, but to have suffered is wonderful. – Des Ford

Suffering Comes Before Fruit
============================
*The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned.* - Isaiah 9:2 NIV

There is no escaping the shadows. Without the shadows there would be no beauty. You ask most parents about their greatest joy and their greatest sorrows, they usually respond with one word: kids.

The greatest illusion is to think you can have pleasure without pain. The birth of every child should teach us a lesson: suffering comes before fruit. In a sinful world that has sneered at the love of God, there is no escaping suffering.

Mountaineers reached the highest peaks and look out over the glories to be seen. I once asked a mountaineer, a few years before he was killed, "Why do you do it? Isn’t it dangerous?”

He answered, “Oh, if you could see the glory, if you could see the splendour looking out over the peaks, you would understand why we do it.”

But then think of the agony of getting up there, the pain, the difficulty breathing, the danger! It is an illusion and delusion to think you can have pleasure without pain.
It is wonderfully comforting to know that God is in control of the pain. He was there at the Cross; when the veil was rent his heart was torn. The blood of Christ was shed, and the heart of God felt the pain.  – Des Ford

The Two Truths of Christianity
==============================
*What are mere mortals that you should think about them, human beings that you should care for them?* - Psalm 8:4, NLT

All our questions about the universe and existence are part of our main question: “What is man?” Who or what is this being that asks the questions?

Only the Christian revelation found in the Bible can rightly answer the question. It rejects the two traditional views: naive optimism (that humans are god-like and perfect) and cynical pessimism (that humans are worthless and totally evil).

Creation and the Fall as recorded in Genesis are the only adequate explanation of the nature of man. Humankind, made in the moral image of God, by disobedience has become a hybrid: half-angel, half-demon.

The Christian religion and the Gospel, revolves around these two truths: there is a God whom we can know, and we are unworthy of him because of our corrupt nature.

It is important for us to know both of these truths. It is equally dangerous for us to know God without knowing our own wretchedness, and to know our own wretchedness without knowing the Redeemer who can free us from it. The knowledge of only one of these points gives rise either to the pride of philosophers, who have known God, and not their own wretchedness, or to the despair of atheists, who know their own wretchedness, but not the Redeemer. – Des Ford

Be Grateful For The Storms
==========================
*Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.* - Matthew 5:4, NIV

To come to God, I must be stripped of my self-sufficiency. The blessed poor in spirit know they do not have in themselves what the righteous law demands.

All human philosophy says sorrow is the great trouble of the earth. Jesus says that sorrow is the great opportunity. Sorrow can empty your hands of dirt, so God can fill them with jewels. Sorrow can remove you quickly from the carnal, the worldly, temporal and evil.

Jesus teaches that the purpose of sorrow is to strand us on the Rock of Ages. Jesus challenges us that if we will see our troubles correctly, they will result in blessing, because trouble punctures the illusion that ‘I am sufficient’.

We are very much like moths that are attracted by the light. The world has many glowing lights: wealth, fame, possessions, power, sex. They can burn us and scorch us. If we use them other than how God says to use them, they can destroy us. But God, in his mercy, empties our hands of tinsel and garbage so he might put something better there.

Jesus challenges us with the astonishing idea: “Blessed are you if you have problems.” He teaches us to say “Thank God” for all the things we think are unbearable weights, insufferable dilemmas, and overwhelming troubles! – Des Ford

You Need Never Walk Alone
=========================
*All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations… and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.* - Matthew 28: 18-20 RSV

We need God. Everything you and I see is transient. Everything we feel, taste, touch – everything is temporary.

There is One who overcame the world, and who said,

    *"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me… lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age."* Matthew 28:18-20 RSV

When our Lord Jesus rose from the dead, he breathed upon his disciples and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (John 20:22). By so doing, he was saying, "Because of the Cross you need never walk alone. Because of the Cross, the omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient God has come to live beside you – and inside you – now and forever." You see, the coming of the Spirit is the coming of God. Jesus said, "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you" (John 14:8 KJV).

It’s true that everything passes away, but not the person who has made Jesus his Saviour. On his last earthly night with his disciples, Jesus said to them,

    *Because I live, you will live also (John 14:19). If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him.* John 14:23, NKJV

From time to time we feel as barren and as fruitless as Aaron’s rod before it budded (Numbers 17). We sometimes feel as empty as the widow’s cruse of oil (1 Kings 17), as desperate as sinking Peter (Matthew 14), and as frustrated as the disciples who fished all night and took nothing in their nets (Luke 5).

Read these stories carefully, for this is a common, recurring, human experience. But is it necessary?

There is One who overcame the world, and who not only said that all authority in heaven and on earth had been given to him, but that he would be with us always. True religion is eternal life lived in the midst of time—in the present. True religion is lived by the power of, and in the company of, God. The original sin that brought misery upon us all happened when man tried to be independent of God (Genesis 3:5).

When our Lord Jesus rose from the dead, he breathed upon his disciples and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit” (John 20:22). In doing this, he was saying, “Because of the Cross, you need never walk alone. Because of the Cross, through me, the omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient God has come to dwell alongside you, and inside you, now and forever.” – Des Ford

How Not To Burn Out
===================
*By faith [Moses] left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible.* - Hebrews 11:27, NIV

Everything in life depends on what you look at. This is much easier to preach than to practice. But Scripture is trying to tell us we can persevere when we see him who is invisible.

My sad experience is that  when trouble comes, I am tempted to look at the trouble only. Things don’t get any better until I find myself repeatedly praying, “Lord, don’t just fix the trouble, fix me. Fix me! Make it more natural for me to see You as bigger, higher, stronger than this threat that faces me.”

Moses didn’t learn this lesson easily. At 40, he blew everything. It’s been said about Moses that he spent 40 years learning to be somebody in Pharaoh’s court; 40 years learning to be nobody, looking after sheep; and only then was God able to use him for the next 40 years.

Moses saw a bush aglow with God: it was burning, but not burnt out. God spoke to Moses out of the bush, and in effect said, “Moses, you were burnt out 40 years ago. You were like one of these shrivelled, desert bushes. But, Moses, if you will accept my presence, you won’t burn out.”

Any old bush will do. It’s not the bush that’s important. It’s the God who’s in the bush. – Des Ford

Make Gratitude a Habit
======================
*And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.* - Colossians 3:17, NIV

I can give you a sure recipe for how to be miserable twenty-four hours a day: think of yourself. People are miserable because they focus on themselves; because they’re not grateful.

If one person in ten ever thanks you, you should thank God, for you’re being treated as well as Jesus in the story recorded in Luke 17:11-19. There can be no worse leprosy than ingratitude.

Who are you? A child of the King! What gratitude this deserves! You and I should be in the habit of thanking God constantly and continuously through every day.

I once saw a cartoon about two people who say to God, “Lord, is it true that a million years to you are just as a second?” The answer comes down, “That’s true.” Then the other person says, “And, Lord, is it true that a million dollars to you are just like a penny?” “Yes,” resounds the answer. “Then, Lord, give us a penny!” they both cry. And the answer comes back: “Wait a second.”

Just think about it: it takes the omnipotent love of God just to cope with our selfishness. Gratitude is the opposite of selfishness. Gratitude is outgoing, selfishness is ingoing. – Des Ford

There is a Remedy ...
=====================
... **For Everyone’s Disease**

*All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.* - Romans 3:23, NIV

The thing that worries me is that the church in the West does not on the whole understand the Gospel, or it would overflow with it. It would be the salt of the earth! It would be the light of the world! From within it would flow rivers of living water instead of drops.

I have preached in third world countries. In those countries when the Gospel is understood, the people overflow! Why doesn’t it happen in the West? Because we have forgotten the Gospel or never come to understand it, and the reason for that is because we are too comfortable and too self-satisfied.

It is because the remedy is never appreciated unless the disease is known. Most people in the west are too comfortable. They mistake a full stomach for a good conscience. They mistake a good suit for the robe of righteousness. They mistake a home for the home of the true church which is composed of all the twice born.

If we don’t know the disease, we will never appreciate the remedy and I submit to you that we in the west do not fully understand the disease. What is the disease? Romans tells us: we have all sinned and we all come short of the glory of God. – Des Ford

Receive Jesus
=============
*As many as received him, to them he gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in his name.* - John 1:12, NKJV

John’s Gospel is the deepest, most beautiful, most wonderful book in the Bible. John presents Jesus as God (John 1:1,3,10,14,18). John's Gospel is also the Gospel that calls for a decision.

Matthew, Mark, and Luke are what are called the synoptic Gospels. "Synoptic” is a technical word meaning “to see the same way,” or “seen together.” Matthew, Mark, and Luke emphasize the human aspect of Christ and focus on what he did.

John's Gospel emphasizes the divine aspect of Christ and focuses on who he is, and what he is. John lingers more on Jesus' words than his deeds, more on Jesus' inner nature than his outer actions. John's Gospel is the Gospel of the divinity of Christ.

But John’s Gospel is not some abstract, theological book, because it asks us an intensely practical question with eternal consequences. It calls for our decision. In effect, John's Gospel says,

"In Matthew, you've seen Jesus as King. He has the right to command us. Our lives are in his hands. In Mark, you've seen Jesus as Servant. We are to serve him with like compassion. In Luke, you've seen the human Jesus saying, “Love's activity grows out of love's contemplation.”

"Now," says John. "Do you receive this Man?" – Des Ford

The Sermon on the Mount ...
===========================
... **Is Our Agenda**

*Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.* - Matthew 5:6, NIV

The Sermon on the Mount is Christ's expansion of his preliminary text, "Repent and believe in the gospel" (Mark 1:15, RSV).

The Sermon on the Mount does not tell us how to be saved. The sermon from the Cross does that: "Jesus, remember me" ... "I tell you the truth today, you will be with me in paradise" (Luke 23:42-43). That's how to be saved: look at the Crucified, and say, "Lord, remember me."

So, the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5–7 does not tell us how to be saved. It tells us who are saved. What are the evidences, the signs and marks that someone has found God?

The Sermon on the Mount tells you whether you have eternal life or not: not by whether your behaviour matches the Sermon's ideals; no one's behaviour does. But by whether the Sermon's ideals are the ideals of your heart. Are the ideals of the Sermon the ideals you hunger and thirst for?

The Sermon on the Mount is not a creed. It's an agenda. It is not telling us what articles of faith to cherish or what we are to believe. It is telling us what to be, and what to do. – Desmond Ford

In the Kingdom ...
==================
... **Happiness Grows Out of What We Are**

*Jesus saw the crowds.* - Matthew 5:1, NIV

Before Jesus spoke the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:1–12), Matthew says that Jesus saw the crowds. He sees the crowds, not as we see them, but as God alone can see them. He saw the people as sinners. He saw them as needy. He saw them as dying. He saw them as unhappy. The crowds seek happiness in what they can have. Jesus knows better.

We were made for happiness, and Jesus knows that happiness does not spring from what we have, but from what we are. This is the clue to the transformed life. People who are always trying to add to their possessions will never find joy. Happiness grows out of what we are.

The Beatitudes are not about the things we strive to have in this world, but rather, the things that we are in the Kingdom. In the Kingdom of God, we are defined by what we are. The Beatitudes are also heaven's congratulations; Christ's set of congratulations to the human race – the benediction of heaven.

There is nothing here to flatter pride, nothing to feed ambitious hopes.
 
Jesus was saying, "Happy are the poor in spirit. Happy are the merciful. Happy are the pure. Happy are the peacemakers." Jesus tells us that we aren’t happy in what we have, but in what we are. – Des Ford

The Sermon on the Mount ...
===========================
... **Teaches You How to Live**

*Whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them.* - Matthew 7:12, NKJV

Other than the words from the Cross, the Sermon on the Mount is the greatest utterance in all human language.
 
The Sermon on the Mount teaches how the Christian should live in the Kingdom of God. The Christian is to love like God, forgive like God, and trust like Christ (John 8:29; 19:11). Jesus walked in the consciousness of the presence of his Father. This is how we are to live.

The Sermon on the Mount has been the comforter and the encourager of all ages; it sweetens life by bringing Heaven down to earth. Think how much it has meant to the world to have the ideal of the golden rule (Matthew 7:12).

The picture of a God who sends rain on the just and the unjust, that causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good – what that has meant to the world! The practical advice about not worrying about tomorrow:

    *“Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.”* Matthew 6:34, NKJV

What that has meant to the world! We get that from the Sermon on the Mount. Only live a day at a time.

    *"In this manner, therefore, pray: ... Give us this day our daily bread."* Matthew 6:9,11, NKJV

Not tomorrow's bread, but this day's. – Des Ford

In the Kingdom ...
==================
... **We Call Out Satan’s Lies**

*Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: “Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah.”* - Revelation 12:10, NIV

The middle verses of the book of Revelation are found in chapter 12. These middle verses are the heart of the Bible’s last book, and they are rejoicing in what the Cross of Christ has done:

    *... for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down.* Revelation 12:10, NKJV

This is an allusion to the words of Jesus in John:

    *Now is the judgment of this world: now the ruler of this world be cast out.* John 12:31

At the Cross, Satan is cast out, and he is called the "accuser of the brethren."

My friends, the worst hours that any of us have are when the devil whispers to us, "You’re no good. You’re a failure. How can God bless such a loser? Look at your track record." And you, my friends, by faith are able to say, "You’re a liar from the beginning, according to the Holy Word of God. But you are a conquered liar. You have been cast out and cast down. The Cross is the answer to your accusations."

When your conscience echoes the devil’s accusations, that’s when you must flee to the Cross, and say, "Satan, you are a liar, for the blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, cleanses us from all sin. *All* sin.” – Des Ford

The Kingdom of Heaven ...
=========================
... **is For the Needy**

*For Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses ... For when I am weak, then I am strong.* - 2 Corinthians 12:10, NIV

One of the most significant thoughts ever to enter my head is this: In Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, there is not one harsh syllable from Christ to anyone who felt their need. That is a wonderful thought. Nowhere in Christ's life story is there one harsh syllable for anyone who had a sense of need.

All Christ's harshness was reserved for those who were spiritually smug – the hypocrites, the self-righteous, and the Laodiceans who considered themselves spiritually wealthy (Revelation 3:14–17). People who think they are rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing are on dangerous ground. They receive our Lord's rebuke. They feel no need for the Kingdom of Heaven.

It is better to feel spiritually needy, for in fact, we are needy. When we feel our neediness, the Lord can bless us. It's wonderful to be weak, for then, and then only, are we ready to receive the Lord’s strength. Awareness of our need is a vacuum Christ can fill.

Despite our weakness, Christ is Conqueror. Though we are weak in faith and feel we are about to be destroyed, life's stormy seas are beneath Christ’s feet, and he has the neck of the serpent, the devil, under his heel. – Des Ford

Giving: ...
===========
... **Not Just for Christmas**

*We know how much God loves us, and we have put our trust in his love. God is love, and all who live in love live in God, and God lives in them.* - 1 John 4:16, NLT

It happens; especially if you're tired. I mean, that moment of semi-panic on Christmas Eve when you think of all the gifts left to buy, and all the cards not sent! It takes energy to plan and do good things, and energy is often sadly lacking, even for the saints.

At times, we might even be tempted to murmur like Scrooge in Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, "Bah, humbug!" But we don't mean it. In our heart of hearts, we know that as long as we are receiving, it is good and right (and a privilege) also to be giving.

Giving does not get us to heaven, but it does bring heaven down to us. God is the greatest giver. To give is to be like God, for giving is loving, and God is love.

    *"Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.”* 1 John 4:8

The main gift God offers to all, this Christmas season, is the everlasting Gospel, the good news of heaven's willing bankruptcy of itself that we might live. That gift received brings with it all other gifts, including the gift of learning to become givers. – Des Ford

Put God First
=============
*Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.* = Matthew 6:33, NKJV

The Bible is full of the 80-20 principle. This principle says that 20 percent of what you do gives you 80 percent of the results. The Bible is continually stressing how we need to prioritise and see things with a true sense of proportion.

A favourite word on the lips of Jesus was “first.” He said things like, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness…. ” Or, “First bind the strong man….” Or, ”The first and great commandment… ”

Jesus also had an eye for people who observed this priority principle. When everybody else was criticizing that poor woman who out of love’s store had anointed him, he said, “Mary has chosen that good thing which shall not be taken from her.” How did she come to do that? Jesus said on the same occasion, “But one thing is needful.”

Mary had a true sense of priorities. She made Jesus first. To Mary, worship was the essence of life.

Let God be God. Either God matters tremendously or he doesn’t matter at all. If God be God, he must be put first, ever and always.

God must be first in every choice. The worship of God must be seen as our first duty and the source of all our fruitfulness and joy. – Des Ford

Don’t Follow Darwin’s Foolishness
=================================

*I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.* - 2 Timothy 4:7, NIV
 
Did Darwin believe in God? Most people in Darwin’s time rejected the concept of atheism. Had Darwin been an atheist, a wall of prejudice would have sprung up between his theory and most of his readers. In 'The Origin of Species' Darwin refers to the Creator seven times. But it is quite certain that he had ceased to be a Christian years before he wrote this book.
 
By 1840 he applied to himself the term invented by Thomas Huxley: “agnostic.” However, Darwin refused to apply to call himself an “atheist.” Darwin was never an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of God. However, he still felt profoundly uncertain.
 
Darwin was a good husband and father, a good neighbour and friend, but nonetheless he was guilty of the greatest sin any person can ever commit — a sin worse than murder, adultery, false witness, or theft. He consistently broke the first and great commandment.
 
Because he permitted his faith in God and Scripture to evaporate so easily, he could never love his Maker with all his heart, mind, and strength. He never sought for, and never found, that Gospel which removes all darkness and bestows all light.

May the dear Lord save us from such foolishness with its inevitable eternal results. – Des Ford

Darwin’s Wrong Conclusion
=========================

*For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.* - 1 Corinthians 1:25, NIV

Very few people know the truth about the most influential book of the last fifteen hundred years, 'On the Origin of Species', by Charles Darwin. This book was based on what now seems a tiny mistake, but it changed the world drastically for the worse.

Darwin proposed the view of life as a struggle for existence, and adopted the resulting motto: “survival of the fittest.” Many scientists have seen that there is a struggle for existence in nature, but it does not have the prominence Darwin gave it. Most species are plant, seed or fruit eaters, and carnivores are much in the minority. Darwin jumped to a conclusion, which has led the world into atheism and a disregard for the sacredness of life. His small mistake has led to the cruel killing of millions by war, as well as social and industrial greed.

Our influence is like the dropping of a stone into water causing wider and wider circles. Small mistakes by any one of us can have tremendous consequences for the lives of many.

Only by much consideration of the person and work of our Saviour can right choices be made. Then, and then only, we shall be a “saviour of life unto life.” – Des Ford

You Belong to God
=================

*You are not your own ... For you were bought at a price.* - 1 Corinthians 6:19–20, NKJV

Did I conceive myself, bear myself, care for myself in the first days, months, years of life? Can I guarantee even one day of my life? How much power do I even have within myself to do what is good?

The old Book is right. We are not our own. All that we can call our own are our mistakes, our sins, our failures, and our innate abysmal selfishness and poverty. All that we count as “plusses” are given to us.

Why is it then that we so often ignore God in the way that we live? Why is it that we live for life’s pleasures, and flee from its obligations?

Stand under the shadow of that ancient Cross and hear Jesus’ plaintive cry, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" He was forsaken that we might forsake our habit of fleeing from the cross of life, which is the Cross of the gospel. If we lift the Cross, it will ultimately will lift us. The sacrificial principal of the Cross must be embraced. When you embrace the cross of service, it gives you wings like a bird and sails like a ship. Our loving, Heavenly Father transforms the pain and misery of Calvary into the songs of Paradise.

We belong to God — every cell, every talent, every capacity for thought, feeling, and action. 

So, sing it gladly: "We are not our own, for we have been bought with a price. That’s why we will we glorify God in our body and in our spirit which are God's.” Hallelujah! – Des Ford

Our Faith comes from Him
************************

The Faith I Want
================
*He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak* - Isaiah 29:40

I want a faith that will keep me steady when every cell of my mind is shrieking, "Why?" I want a faith that keeps me strong when every part of my body is resonating with pain. I want a faith that keeps me faithful when temptation sucks at me like a hurricane on a mountaintop. I want a faith that's bigger than the towering questions that plague me as I swim in the tempestuous sea of existence.

Ultimately, people only believe what they wish to believe. After all, a small eyelid can shut out the entire sun. The sun is equivalent in size to about a million of our earths. It's pretty big up there, but my tiny eyelid can shut it out.

The main reason for unbelief is not an intellectual one. It is moral. Julian Huxley said, "I was so relieved to find out there is no God, I could live as I liked." And there you have it.

God is a great embarrassment to us. If I want to lie, God says, "Speak the truth." If I want to fornicate, God says, "Be pure." If I want to steal, God says, "Be honest." But only God can give me the faith I need. – Des Ford

You Have Eternity to Win
========================
*The love of Christ compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.* - 2 Corinthians. 5:14

The Frenchman, Blaise Pascal [1623-62], was a genius. He invented and sold the first calculating machine, a forerunner of the computer. He also planned the public transportation system for Paris. Pascal had a wager for unbelievers:

    Belief in God is rational. That's because if God does not exist, one stands to lose nothing by believing in him anyway; while if God does exist, one stands to lose everything by not believing.

The believer has everything to win and nothing to lose by believing. Of course, Pascal's Wager is not the reason we become Christians, despite the truth of his wager.

The reason we become Christians is because the love of Christ compels us (see 2 Corinthians 5:14 KJV). But it doesn't hurt to remember that the believer has heaven, eternity, joy, meaning, and reason – all these glorious things to gain. The unbeliever has everything to lose, and nothing to win.

The thief on the cross took up Pascal’s wager. This man, at the end of a life that had been filled with evil, was suddenly confronted with God's incarnate love. He called out to Jesus, "Lord, remember me." And Grace answered him, “Not only will you be remembered, but you will be with me in Paradise.” – Des Ford

The Secret of Peace
===================
*Grace and peace to you from Him who is, and who was, and who is to come.* - Revelation 1:4

Please note the order. You can't have peace without grace. You always get grace before you get peace.

Only when you accept the grace of God can you have God's peace – the same Greek word means “gift.” “Grace and peace,” that's always the order. Don't look for peace, and hope that then you'll find grace. When you accept grace, you get peace.

Remember when, after His resurrection, Jesus met with His disciples in the upper room? The disciples were scared to death! They had all forsaken Jesus and fled. That was their last contact with Him.

Suddenly, He appears – the one they had forsaken! Jesus says,

    *"Don't let your hearts be troubled. Behold My hands and My feet. Peace be unto you."* -  John 20:19-31
    
When they saw the wounds in His hands and His feet, they heard His words, “peace be unto you.” That's the foundation of peace, that He was wounded for our sake and in our place. – Des Ford

You Can Steal Paradise!
=======================
*You will be with Me in Paradise.* - Luke 23:43

The Bible records only one deathbed repentance: only one, so no one would despair, but only one, so no one would presume. Who could imagine in a thousand years a better way of illustrating Christ's Gospel: grace and love triumphs over sin and death in the face of true repentance. This man with blood on his hands, who had nourished hatred and violence in his heart, is transformed by the magnetic appeal of the One suffering in his stead. Now this thief makes the biggest “steal” of his life – Paradise! And the Owner of Paradise rejoices to let him do it!

In his rebuke of his brother thief, he includes himself as guilty and deserving of death, yet in his appeal to Christ he takes hold of life beyond the Cross.

Why is he saved rather than the very religious Pharisees and the philosophic Sadducees? Because he has a sense of need and an awareness of his true lost estate. Even the Son of God cannot save one who has no awareness of need. The greatest blessing in the world for the unconverted, is not wealth or talent or position, but the sense of one's true estate: 

    **one's guilt before God and an inability to deal with it**

This the thief had, and consequently, Paradise was his. – Des Ford

We Must Be Born Again
=====================
*Except a man be born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.* - John 3:3

Christ said these words to a nocturnal visitor two thousand years ago. On another occasions He expressed the same thought in the following way:

    *"Except you be converted, and become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."* - Matthew 18:3

These "excepts" stand between every man and eternal life.

Consider the **most frightening aspect** of Christ’s words: “You must be born again” – namely, the character of the person to whom He spoke them. It was not to a Mary Magdalene, a lady of the night. It was not to Zacchaeus, a cheat and thief. Christ’s words were addressed to a man of spotless reputation who spoke Sabbath by Sabbath at one of the leading metropolitan churches:  *Nicodemus, the teacher of Israel*. (See John 3:10, RV.)

Which of us would claim a character as lofty as his or a mind as enlightened as his? Yet even Nicodemus needed to be born again. No wonder that when Wesley was asked why he preached so often on the text "You must be born again," his reply was, "Because 'you must be born again.'" – Desmond Ford

You Matter to God
=================
*For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.* - John 3:16, KJV

Jesus died for your sins. You should know this, for the Bible is full of the wonderful word “whosoever.”

Jesus so loved the world that he died (John 3:16). Do you live in this world, or somewhere else? If you live in the world, he died for you. God so loved you that he gave his Son for you. When Christ suffered on the Cross, he suffered for you, just as though it was only for you. It is the one lost sheep the shepherd goes after. The one is significant.

Napoleon was once asked, "Did you lose anyone important in the battle?" "Oh, no," he replied, "a few score thousand soldiers died, but no one of importance."

I wonder what the mothers thought. 

God is not like that. God is more like the librarian who knows every book in the library. We all matter to God. It doesn't matter who you are. Do you remember what Christ said through the angel to the women at his tomb?

    *"Go tell his disciples and Peter ..."* - Mark 16:7 NIV

He remembered Peter. – Des Ford

True Knowledge of God ...
=========================
... **Changes Everything!**

*Let the one who boasts, boast about this: that they have the understanding to know me, that I am the Lord, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight.* - Jeremiah 9:24

In the ancient book of Job we have the invitation:

    *acquaint now yourself with him and be at peace* - Job 22:21

Centuries later, Jesus of Nazareth echoed these words when he said:

    "Come ... learn of me ... and ye shall find rest unto your souls.* - Matthew 11:28, 29

In terms of our spiritual nature and potential, it is the knowledge of God that we chiefly need. If that be so, we might anticipate that the Devil would do all he could to give us a false picture of God. How well he has succeeded!

Think of your early childhood pictures of God and analyse your present ones. Poor God often comes out looking like a policeman in a white shirt, with his brow furrowed and his finger raised in warning.

Such immature and inaccurate pictures, of course, conflict strangely with biblical passages such as:

    *Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him*  - Psalm 103:13
    
    *As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you* - Isaiah 66:13
    
    *The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth ... forgiving iniquity* - Exodus 34:6,7

Should we not strive to have a more accurate, biblical picture of our Maker, Redeemer and Judge? – Des Ford

God’s Presence is With You
==========================
*Where can I go from your spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there. If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, even there your hand will guide me; your right hand will hold me fast.* - Psalm 139:7-9

The Bible speaks of this reality throughout its pages:

    *He is not far from each one of us. For in him we live and move and have our being.* - Acts 17:27- 28
    *And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.* - Matthew 28:20

Moses:

    *persevered because he saw him who is invisible.* - Hebrews 11:27

Jeremiah testifies concerning God:

    *You came near when I called you, and you said, "Do not fear."* - Lamentations 3:57

Neither was this truth news to the Psalmist. Consider the 139th Psalm, quoted above. Israel for three thousand years has sung the shepherd King's rhetorical question, “Where can I flee from your presence?” So confident is the Psalmist of God's omnipresence and omniscience that he declares God's thoughts about him to be more in number than the sand grains of the earth's mighty oceans (see v.17-18). Then he adds:

    *“When I awake, I am still with you.”* v.18

To practice the presence of God continually is to bring rest of soul, peace of mind, and happiness of spirit. It grants freedom from undue anxiety, and wisdom for the way. Satan strives to make us doubt the Divine presence (see Psalm 42:6, 7, 9,10). But in answer, God exhausts the synonyms of language to assure us of his abiding nearness. – Des Ford

Reach Out to Jesus ...
======================
... **With the Touch of Faith**

*Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed.* - Mark 5:34, NKJV

Mark tells the story of the woman who had been subject to bleeding for 12 years. "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed," she thought (Mark 5:28). She touched Jesus and was healed. Jesus turned and asked, "Who touched my clothes?" (v. 30). The disciples answered, "Look at all these people crowding around you! How can you ask who touched you?" (v. 31, CEV).

But this touch was different. The woman's touch was the touch of faith. Mark is telling us that it's not enough to know that Jesus is the Sacrifice who has delivered us, or the Saviour of the world, or the Mighty Worker on our behalf. It's only enough if we put out our hand and touch him.

This touch of faith isn’t the casual touch of the careless throng that goes to church, sings the hymns, puts money in the offering plate – and then forgets all about it as soon as the last song is sung. They don't know the touch of faith.

It's not enough to be surrounded by religion. It's only enough to touch Jesus and have a personal relationship with him.

    *"Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life."* John 6:54 NIV

No one can eat and drink for you. You must eat and drink for yourself. It must be personal. – Des Ford

Jesus Takes Us Apart From The Crowd
===================================
*After Jesus had taken him aside from the crowd, he stuck his fingers in the man's ears. Then he spit and put it on the man's tongue. Jesus looked up toward heaven, and with a groan he said "Effatha!" which means "Open up!" At once the man could hear, and he had no more trouble talking clearly.* - Mark 7:33-35 CEV

The personal touch of Jesus is everywhere in the Gospel of Mark. In chapter seven we have a typical story of how Jesus served.

Some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk. They begged Jesus just to touch him (Mark 7:31-32 CEV).

We are all like that man. We are deaf to God. That's how we were born. Because of that we cannot speak for God. So often the words that come from our mouths witness to the devil.

What does Christ do? First, Jesus takes the man "aside from the crowd," and then he touches him. If you want to be like everybody else, forget it! Jesus has to take you away from the multitude. He will set you apart in your thinking and in your behaviour. A Christian stands out from the crowd.

You measure a tall building by the shadow it casts. That's the way you measure a person. No shadow, no height. To be a Christian, you've got to be different, and you may not be loved because you're different. People fear those who are different.

Jesus took the man aside from the crowd, touched him, looked to heaven, "and with a groan," healed him. Our healing is only made possible through the sorrows of Christ. – Des Ford

Saving Faith Can Be Yours
=========================
*My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.* - 2 Corinthians 12:9 NKJV

Scripture promises that God will show us the path of life. Unless he does, we will inevitably wander in hopeless circles among the tombs of the dead, soon to lie down beside them in their darkness. We need the light of the world (John 8:12; 1:9) to shine upon us every moment, as the Psalmist says, 

    *In Your light we see light.* Psalm 36:9

The Lord fills the hungry with good things but turns the rich away. He pulls princes down from their thrones and exalts beggars from their dunghills. When we know we are weak, we are strong:

    *The way of man is not in himself; It is not in man who walks to direct his own steps.* Jeremiah 10:23, NKJV

Saving faith grasps the merits of the Divine-human sacrifice for the sins of the world, and applies the merits of that sacrifice to one's own soul. It is the sense of dependence that characterised the lepers Christ healed, the beggars he enriched, the despairing he encouraged, and the dying to whom he gave life. This same sense of dependence is the beginning and the root of saving faith. – Des Ford

Faith Is Not The Greatest Virtue
================================
*Three things will last forever — faith, hope and love — and the greatest of these is love.* - 1 Corinthians 13:13, NLT

Although faith is the key to all the treasures of this life and the next, although it is the first of all the virtues, it is certainly not the greatest. It is great in that it leads to the greater. For faith is both self-emptying and receiving of the Divine Spirit. And when the Divine Spirit comes, faith becomes perfect in love. Thus, though faith is the first, love is always the best.

The Christian believer has privileges! Confessing his or her own emptiness, poverty, inability and folly, the pleading outstretched hand takes hold of the Almighty whose name is Love. And now the world is transformed and everybody in it.

The world becomes our Father's school, and all the other students are our brothers and sisters. Life's hardships and joys, as well as the Scriptures of truth, are our lesson books. As long as we are in this age of sin, there will be sorrow and error and tensions. On the other hand, through faith in God's leading, there is glorious light, and power, and the best of all fruits: enduring, invincible love. – Des Ford

God Has Told You ...
====================
... **Who The Real Enemy Is**

*All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.* - Romans 3:23 NIV

No Christian need be ashamed of affirming that the doctrine of human depravity gives the only true explanation for human sorrow and folly. The Bible is a wonderfully concentrated book. It refuses to be diverted from its one topic of humanity’s need of salvation, and the remedy. Therefore the sin of man is emphasized on every page. There is no part of man's nature that hasn’t come under the dominion of sin.

If a besieged company of soldiers in a fortress were always looking over the parapet to the east, expecting devastation from that quarter, would they not have been grateful to someone wiser who pointed out that their real enemy was coming from another point of the compass? Should not we be grateful to God that he has told us again, and again, and again, that our real enemy is not what we think it is? It is not our poverty or difficult circumstances. It is not the evil of other people. It is not the cruelties of nature or any one of a thousand other things that we blame.

Our real evil is within. A wise man once declared that he had had more trouble with himself than any other man he had ever met. – Des Ford

Always Be Praying
=================
*Because He has inclined His ear to me, Therefore I will call upon Him as long as I live.* - Psalm 116:2, NKJV

Funnily enough, we have a strange idea about prayer. We think that prayer is for when we get up in the morning and before we go to bed at night.

When Ruth Graham (evangelist Billy Graham’s wife) was asked about her prayer life, she said, “I pray on the hoof.” The kind of prayer that the Bible recommends is not long, public prayer, but brief, frequent prayer. Prayer is constant communion with God.

The best way to pray is the way Christ exemplified. His prayers were short, powerful, but frequent. That’s the best prayer life. By all means pray in the morning; by all means pray in the evening. But prayer “on the hoof” is the best way. This is what theologians call “ejaculatory prayer,” or short, brief prayers. (See Nehemiah 1:5-11; 2:4; 4:9; 6:9; Genesis 17:18.) 

Prayer “on the hoof” is real praying: praying all the time, about everything. The way you should pray for people is when the Lord puts them upon your heart. As soon as you have a worry about them, commit them to God.

I pray when I collect mail, and I pray as I answer all those letters. For 50 years I’ve prayed as I’ve walked, or as I’ve jogged. True prayer life is a constant communion. – Desmond Ford

Believe Your Beliefs...
=======================
... **and Doubt Your Doubts**

*Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!"* - Mark 9:24, NKJV

If there is no God, no Creator of the universe, then my brain is the result of the play of meaningless atoms in time and space. If this were the case, how could I trust its conclusions?

Where did thought come from? If thought matches reality, there had to be an infinite and wise Creator who gave us consciousness. But if our thoughts are the result of chance then we should no more trust their conclusions than we should expect the splash of an accidental jug spilling to give us a map of Australia.

If the Bible’s picture of a loving heavenly Father is only a myth, and life is meaningless, we could never come to the point of understanding joy and sorrow. We would never know darkness unless we first knew light. Suppose there was no light and we had no eyes, then the word ‘dark’ would have no meaning. It is because we know the reality of God and good that we feel the intensity of darkness and pain. The One who made the world made your brain and your standard of what is right and good. Every accusation against God is built on a standard, and our standard came from him who made us.

Believe your beliefs and doubt your doubts. Never doubt your beliefs and believe your doubts. Never let what you don’t understand destroy what you do understand. – Des Ford

All Things Work Together For Good
=================================
*We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.* - Romans 8:28, NKJV

The testimony of Scripture is that all things work together for good to those who love God. We have a Christ who gathers up the fragments so that nothing is lost. Without suffering there would be no sympathy; without hardship there would be no hardihood; without pain there would be no patience. There is no way to holiness except through hell.

There are two ways to react to the troubles of life. Jacob said,

    *“All these things are against me.”* Genesis 42:36

But Joseph said,

    *“You meant it for evil but God meant it for good.”* Genesis 50:20

Year after year, after being shipwrecked, stoned, beaten with rods, meeting with false brethren, enduring a thorn in the flesh, Paul could say,

    *For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor things present or things to come, nor principalities or powers, nor any other created thing is able to separate us from the love of God in Christ, Jesus, our Lord.* Romans 8:38–39

We’ve got to learn to dance Adam’s dance backward. He disbelieved the Word of God and disobeyed; but we have to learn to believe the Word of God and obey. – Des Ford

Christ’s All-Conquering Church
==============================
*Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.* - Matthew 16:18 KJV

What a prediction! What a claim! Here we are almost twenty centuries later, and about one in three people around the globe claims membership in Christ’s church. The picture in Matthew 16:18 is that of an advancing kingdom of God converging on the gates of hell and death, error and bloody persecution. The victorious army is clothed in righteousness. Its banner is the Spirit, lifting high the blessed Gospel of Christ.

However, we must never confuse the church invisible of Matthew 16:18 with the visible church. Scripture tells us concerning the church: “There is one body” (Ephesians 4:4, compare 1 Corinthians 12:12).

Are you a member of the true church? Have you built your faith, not upon a human creed, but upon the God-human, the church’s one Foundation, Jesus Christ? Have you received the anointing of the Holy Spirit? He is yours immediately upon your committal to Christ. Do you bear the mark of the genuine disciple? Here it is:

    *By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.* John 13:35; Matthew 25:34,40

In Christ, you are a member of that true church against which the gates of hell shall never prevail. – Des Ford

The Humble Church
=================
*The foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.* - 1 Corinthians 1:25, NIV

When the true Christ came, He came in disguise. They expected a conqueror, but He came as a carpenter; they expected a king but He came as a peasant; they expected one who was lofty, but He came in lowly guise; they expected one clothed with glory but He came clothed with humility; they anticipated their Messiah would proclaim law, but when He did come He proclaimed love.

**The true church, like the true Christ, is always in disguise.**

Christ uses the following metaphors in picturing the Christian life: the yoke, the towel, the sword, and the cross. A watered-down gospel offering only an anaesthetic is not the genuine article. But look at that man Simon on the Via Dolorosa carrying his cross behind Christ – there is a picture of the true church. See Mary breaking her expensive box of perfume – there is another picture. See Christ washing His disciples’ feet – a third picture. And most of all, observe the Man hanging on the cross!

The true gospel is ever crucified between two thieving false gospels. Those perennial religious thieves are legalism and antinomianism. Both lack the true love and the true faith that are central for the genuine gospel of God. – Des Ford

*In building the temple, only blocks dressed at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built.* - 1 Kings 6:7, NIV

Solomon’s life was marked by glory, riches, wisdom, and peace. Do you know what the name “Solomon” means? “Solomon” means “peaceful.” Solomon is thought of as the wisest man who ever lived, the richest man who ever lived, and he had a glorious kingdom (1 Kings 5:4)

But I have left out the best thing about Solomon. He built the temple.

That temple was a symbol of the church. Just as Solomon built the temple, Christ said, “On this rock I’ll build my church” (Matthew 16:18). We are the living stones and we were cut out not by hammer or chisel but by the silent moving and moulding of the Holy Spirit. In silence, we were prepared to be living stones in the living temple of Christ’s church.

Christ talked about the Spirit, likening him to the wind. The wind blows where it likes. You can’t see it. It makes a sound but it is mysterious (John 3:8). So too the temple. The temple went up without noise, with everything prepared away from it. We are those living stones prepared by the silent moving of the Spirit (1 Peter 2:5). − Des Ford

You Can Tell God’s True Church ...
==================================
... **From The False**

*We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren.* - 1 John 3:14

Jerusalem becomes Babylon when it offers only rest instead of rest conjoined with battle. Babylon knows only a gospel of good advice and good views instead of the Good News.
 
Babylon has a series of orthodox works and beliefs that bring artificial rest rather than the ecstatic gladness resulting from the knowledge that our sins have been dealt with and the decision (acquittal) of the Last Judgement is ours already.
 
Babylon has much to say about man while the true church points first to what God has done in the God-man. Babylon fears the second coming and finds witnessing a burden, but the true church, having accepted Christ’s atonement is ready today through His imputed merits. And it loves to witness to God’s other lost children, telling them they have already been redeemed (See Romans 5:14-19.)
 
A church is not a church when it ceases to bring forth the unselfish fruit of love that results from a living union with the Redeemer.
 
The false church preaches itself rather than its Lord and has forgotten that justification comes freely through the grace of God, meritoriously by the blood of Christ, instrumentally by faith, and evidentially by willing works of love. –

Peace Be With You!
==================
*Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.* - John 14:27, ESV

Twice, Jesus said to his disciples, “Peace be with you!”

Our first peace comes to us when we see the wounds of Jesus and understand that he was crucified and slain for our sins. Peace comes to those who know that Jesus has paid the full penalty for their sins. They have peace in their hearts because they are no longer under God’s condemnation. This is a deep peace.

The second peace takes a person even deeper, because it is hard to enjoy the first peace of salvation while others are missing out on it. The first peace is salvation for you; this second peace comes when you offer salvation to others. Jesus is here commissioning you to go to others to share his salvation with them.

Pray that the Spirit of God himself will fill you and help you bring salvation to others. When you win souls for Jesus, great peace and happiness will fill you to overflowing. - Des Ford

The Greatest Truth ...
======================
... **of Christianity**

*We believe ... and we know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.* - John 4:42, NKJV

The greatest truth of Christianity is that Christ is the spotless Son of God, the divine Saviour.

In a dream Jacob saw a ladder extending from heaven to earth (Genesis 28:10-22). Jesus is that ladder (John 1). By his divinity, he reaches the heavens. By his humanity, he touches us on earth. If we break the ladder on either end, we have no Saviour, no connection with heaven. The heavens remain silent and empty, and earth is but a grave.

The very first truth about Christianity is that Christ is divine, the spotless Son of God. Unless we are clear on who Christ is, we will not be clear on anything else. The Cross is the only lever that can lift the world to God. It is the magnetic attraction that draws men and women out of the maelstrom of sin. The Cross has revealed the love of God in a way nothing else could.

A true Christian is clear on the nature of Christ. Christ is our spotless sacrifice, the Creator of all things, and the Redeemer of the world. – Des Ford

Where Does Thought Come From?
=============================

*Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!* - Mark 9:24, NKJV

There is evil in the world, which sometimes makes us question and doubt. However, it makes no sense to deny the existence of God because there is evil in the world. First, ask the question, why do you know that there is evil at all? To accuse God means to have a standard. Where does your standard come from? It comes from the One who made the world, made your brain, and who gave you your standard of what is right and good.

If my brain is the result of the play of meaningless atoms in time and space, I have no grounds to trust its conclusions. No one yet has ever answered the question: where did thought come from? If thought matches reality, there had to be an infinite and wise Creator who gave us consciousness. But if our thoughts are the result of chance, then we should no more trust their conclusions than we should expect the accidental splash from a jug to give us a map of Australia.

Yes, there is much that we still do not understand. The Christian has not yet been glorified. He or she every day does battle with selfishness and sin. 

And doubts remain. We cry with the father in the New Testament: “Lord, I believe, help my unbelief.” – Des Ford

What Gives the Bible ...
========================
... **its Authority?**

*God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by His Son.* - Hebrews 1:1–2, NKJV

Some see in the Bible merely a collection of historical documents, most of them inaccurate. Others see in Scripture the very word of God.

The Bible is composed of many forms of literature; it underwent a multifaceted process of production with human authors and even editors. Why then, should I pay attention to the Bible? Why should I be concerned with believing and living according to its standards and directions?

Because the Bible answers the problems of this world - as a perfect key matches a lock - it reveals God as nothing else in creation reveals him. Above all, the Bible witnesses to the most unique person ever seen on this planet – Jesus Christ – whose words after twenty centuries still come to us fragrant and fresh, pungent and powerful.

The reason why so many through the centuries have sensed an authority in the Bible that transcends the authority of all other books is that through it, God has revealed himself to us. He did it over millennia through the many authors and genres, and finally he did it through Christ, who gives meaning and authority to the whole. – Des Ford

The New Testament ...
=====================
... **Was Not Made Up**

*Many people have set out to write accounts about the events that have been fulfilled among us. They used the eyewitness reports circulating among us from the early disciples.* - Luke 1:1–2, NLT

Galatians 1 carries the ring of truth. Here is a man confessing that he had been a blasphemer and a persecutor, but been turned around by the miraculous intervention of God. In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul says that five hundred people, of whom the majority were still alive at the time when he wrote, saw the resurrected Christ. The second Gospel was written by Mark, who was Peter’s scribe. How fascinating to find that it is Mark's Gospel that sets Peter in the worst light!

John the Baptist is presented as having his doubts concerning the character of Jesus (Matthew 11:3). We read that many of Christ's disciples left him (John 26:56). Matthew confesses that in his hometown, Christ did not work many miracles (Matthew 13:58).

Luke quotes the scorn of unbelievers who called Christianity a superstition (Acts 25:18-19). In the Gospels we find the surprising note that even Christ's own relatives thought he might be going insane. When our Lord's post-resurrection appearances are described, he is presented as appearing to believers only. Wouldn't it have made a better story if the Gospel writers had pictured him as appearing to Pilate and Herod?
 
The authors of the New Testament were more interested in the facts, than the impression their story might give. The New Testament has the ring of truth. – Des Ford

How Abraham Was Justified
=========================

*Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness.* - Genesis 15:6, NIV

The first time the word “righteousness” is mentioned in Scripture is in Genesis 15:6. This is also the first verse containing the word “believed”.

Abraham was not declared righteous because of any of his good works, although he had done many. Neither did ceremonial nor ritualistic works justify him, for he was declared righteous before his circumcision. Nor was he justified on the ground of his faith, for it was yet imperfect.

Abraham was justified as a result of the coming Seed, Jesus. **Faith was but the hand that received**. Faith is not the basis of God's gift. All are justified by means of faith, that is, through faith; but not because of, or as a result of, faith. Justification through faith means justification through Jesus.

The way that Abraham was justified is the pattern for all of us. And how we all need justification! Not one of us is what we should be, could be, or would be. The perfect law demands not merely perfect outward performance but perfect attitude of heart, perfect motives from a perfect heart. We don’t have any of these to offer. – Des Ford
