Disclaimer / Introduction
=========================
I feel quite blessed to receive in my email a daily reminder that God loves me, died for me and wants my salvation much more than even I do, which is at the same time sad - as it is an indictment of my laodicean Christian mindset - and yet reassuring, because there's hope for even me.

The text in this document are saved emailed devotionals, generously provided by `Good News Unlimited <https://www.goodnewsunlimited.com/>`_. They feature the writings of pastor Elieser Gonzalez, Dr Desmond Ford and the great Charles Spurgeon. The text has been used without permission, but with the express purpose to promote the important message the words carry. I am quite certain in providing these pages I am working in line with the authors of the text and not stealing anything they are giving me: they are giving this to all of us!

I hope that these pages may prove helpful and provide hope to others, as much as this message has provided hope to me.
