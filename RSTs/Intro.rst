Why These Pages? 
================

I feel quite blessed to receive in my email a daily reminder that God loves me, died for me and wants my salvation much more than even I do, which is at the same time sad - as it is an indictment of my laodicean Christian mindset - and yet reassuring, because there's hope for *even me*.

The text in this document are saved emailed devotionals, generously provided by `Good News Unlimited <https://www.goodnewsunlimited.com/>`_. They feature the writings of pastor Elieser Gonzalez, Dr Desmond Ford and the great Charles Spurgeon, as well as a few select writings by other authors.

The text has been copied from the emails and used without permission, but with the express purpose to **promote the important message the words carry**. These writers said what I feel so much more eloquently and accurately, with a wealth of scriptural knowledge based on years of study - work that seems ever so underexposed and unappreciated for the wealth of power and inspiration contained therein, so I felt compelled to give it an additional face to the web in the hopes more would see, read and be as thankful as I am for these words!

I am quite certain in providing these pages I am working in line with the authors of the text and not stealing anything they are giving me: they are giving this to all of us!

**I hope that these pages may prove helpful and provide hope to others, as much as this message has provided hope to me.**

How Evolution Destroys Reason
=============================

*“Come now, and let us reason together,” says the Lord.* - Isaiah 1:18, NKJV

Human intellect is free to destroy itself. Just as one generation could prevent the very existence of the next generation, by all entering a monastery or jumping into the sea, so one set of thinkers can in some degree prevent further thinking. How could it do that? By teaching the next generation that there is no validity in any human thought.

It is idle to talk always of reason as an alternative to faith. Reason is itself a matter of faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all.

It is not faith that stops thought. But there is a thought that stops thought. That is the only thought that ought to be stopped.

Evolution is a good example of that modern intelligence which, if it destroys anything, destroys itself. Evolution is an attack upon thought itself. If evolution destroys anything, it does not destroy religion, but rationalism.

Evolution is an attack, not upon the faith, but upon the mind; you cannot think, if there are no things to think about. And if there is nothing to think about other than the random movements of atoms, of which your mind is also comprised, what is there left to think about? – G.K. Chesterton

The Truth of Christ’s Claims
============================

*I am the First and the Last. I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever!* - Revelation 1:17–18, NIV

The most natural explanation of Christ is the supernatural. If he was good, he was God. The people who knew him believed him to be good.  Here are the words of C.S. Lewis:

    *His legislation extended to the inmost motives of action, and covered in its wide sweep all the particulars of conduct. In the Sermon on the Mount he spoke with an authority which was expressly contrasted with that of all previous lawgivers…. He laid claim to the absolute allegiance of every soul. To those who complied, he promised blessedness in the life to come. There can be no doubt that he assumed to exercise the prerogative of pardoning sin. Apart from declarations, uttered in an authoritative tone, of the terms on which God would forgive sin, he assured individuals of the pardon of transgressions. He taught that his death stood in the closest relation to the remission of sins. He uttered, there is no reason to doubt, the largest predictions concerning the prospective growth of his spiritual empire. The government of the world would be shaped with reference to this end.* - C.S. Lewis

One wrong word or act would have destroyed Christ’s claims to be God, but **there was none**. - Des Ford, with C.S. Lewis

The Grace of the Lord Jesus ...
===============================
... **is With You**

*The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.* - Revelation 22:21, NKJV

The Bible closes with this blessing. It is a summary of all of the blessings that God has promised us. Grace abounding! Divine favor, unbought, unsolicited, and undeserved! The Bible begins and ends with this.

This is the 'good news' which the Cross of Christ has made available; the 'good news' which remains 'good' to the last, unchanged by the lapse of time. The free love of God, coming to us through His Son, has not been exhausted.

This grace has been shown to us in many ways, but mainly in the Cross. The Cross did not originate grace, but it made it a righteous thing for us to receive.
When Jesus said "it is finished" as he died on the Cross, he broke down the barriers that stood between the sinner and the grace. This grace flows everywhere throughout a guilty earth; but its centre is the Cross; and only in connection with the Cross is it available to us.

We accept this grace simply by taking it as it is, and as we are; by letting it flow into us; by believing what God says about it. Grace does not ask us to prepare to receive it, in fact we must be worthless and guilty. If we needed to be anything else before receiving it, grace would be not grace. – Horatius Bonar

Jesus Christ is the Way ...
===========================
... **to Salvation**

*No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.* - John 6:44, NKJV

Faith alone, when based upon the sure promises of God, must save us. All that human ingenuity can devise, no matter how holy and attractive, contributes nothing to our salvation according to God’s way. God saves us in a different way from that which we ourselves plan. Humans can forever do what they want, but they can never enter heaven unless God takes the first step with his Word, which offers them divine grace and enlightens their hearts to show us the right way.

The right way, however, is the Lord Jesus Christ. Whoever desires to seek another path has already missed the right way; for Paul says to the Galatians: “If righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died in vain” (Galatians 2:21). Therefore I say people must fall upon this Gospel and be broken to pieces and in deep consciousness lie prostrate, like someone who is powerless, unable to move hand or foot. You must only lie motionless and cry: “Almighty God, merciful Father, help me now! I cannot help myself. Christ, my Lord, help me now, for with my own effort all is lost!” – Martin Luther

Confess and Believe
===================

*Immediately the girl arose and walked.* - Mark 5:42, NKJV

When we get to the end of our tether and almost despair of help, as Jairus did after he was informed that his little daughter was dead, that is when living, desperate faith lays hold and cries, "It shall be done!"

Sickness, and even death, cannot exist in the Presence of Christ. That’s why the girl immediately arose and walked.

The Bible tells us "Only acknowledge your iniquity..." (Jeremiah 3:13, NKJV) and "Only believe..." (Mark 5:36). Here we have two preparatory steps to victory and Heaven. Everyone, regardless of how wicked they have been, is sure to be victorious if they can only confess and believe.

During the Reformation, Luther saw the futility of working in order to find peace. That’s why he preached "Justification by faith."

It was not long, however, until this truth was abused, and some began to cry, "Only believe! Only believe!" For, said they, "If we are justified by faith, and not by works, then why confess? Believe, and it is done." This sounded good, but it soon became a matter of the head rather than of heart faith.

Friend, like the daughter of Jairus, when you confess and believe, you will also arise and walk in newness of life. – E.E. Shelhamer

The Gentleness of God
=====================

*As an eagle stirs up its nest, Hovers over its young, Spreading out its wings, taking them up, Carrying them on its wings, So the Lord alone led him.* - Deuteronomy 32:11–12

These words are taken from the swan song of Moses. In that song there is a remarkable alternation between praise and blame. It celebrates the goodness and faithfulness of God; it chronicles the wickedness and unfaithfulness of His people.

As I watch the eagles at their work I am impressed with their strength and the consequent security of the eaglets. Watch the eagles' wings in the storm. They seem to beat back the rushing of the wind and master it, or use their strength to travel with it.

Watch the eagles' wings as they fight off an enemy, and see with what skill they beat down the foe that would harm the eaglets. Watch the wings as they brood over the eaglets, and mark their gentleness.

Gentleness is not weakness; gentleness is strength held in restraint. We talk, said George Matheson, of the gentleness of the brook. The brook has no gentleness. It rushes and roars down its way over the pebbles.

If we would speak of gentleness let us stand on the beach and see the mighty ocean with silver foam kiss the feet of the little child that plays on the shore. That is gentleness. That is the true picture of God. – G. Campbell Morgan

There Was No Room For Jesus...
==============================
... **But There’s Room For You**

*There was no room for them in the inn.* - Luke 2:7
*Yet there is room.* - Luke 14:22

Although "there was no room" for Christ at Bethlehem's inn, yet, as the second part of our text explains, "there is room" for you in His heart of love, in His Kingdom of Grace, in His Father's heavenly mansions. At His manger crib "there is room' for every sinner, especially the desperate and downtrodden. That includes you, with all the guilt and wrongdoing and regrets that disturb you.

When you come to Jesus in faith and He comes to you in His mercy, He removes the curse of your sin. He washes away its stain. The fire of His devotion burns away your iniquity. The power of His presence purifies your heart and strengthens your life. Take courage and believe on this Christmas Day that nothing can keep you from Bethlehem and the forgiveness of the newborn Saviour!

From shore to shore let us unite in exulting, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men," all through the Christ Child for whom “there was no room" at His birth, but through whom, by the rebirth of faith, we find eternal room! God grant every one of you this Christmas blessing! Amen! – Walter A. Maier
