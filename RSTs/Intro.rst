Why These Pages? 
================

I feel quite blessed to receive in my email a daily reminder that God loves me, died for me and wants my salvation much more than even I do, which is at the same time sad - as it is an indictment of my laodicean Christian mindset - and yet reassuring, because there's hope for even me.

The text in this document are saved emailed devotionals, generously provided by `Good News Unlimited <https://www.goodnewsunlimited.com/>`_.

I am quite certain in providing these pages I am working in line with the authors of the text and not stealing anything they are giving me: they are giving this to all of us!

I hope that these pages may prove helpful and provide hope to others, as much as this message has provided hope to me.

How Evolution Destroys Reason
=============================

*“Come now, and let us reason together,” says the Lord.* - Isaiah 1:18, NKJV

Human intellect is free to destroy itself. Just as one generation could prevent the very existence of the next generation, by all entering a monastery or jumping into the sea, so one set of thinkers can in some degree prevent further thinking. How could it do that? By teaching the next generation that there is no validity in any human thought.

It is idle to talk always of reason as an alternative to faith. Reason is itself a matter of faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all.

It is not faith that stops thought. But there is a thought that stops thought. That is the only thought that ought to be stopped.

Evolution is a good example of that modern intelligence which, if it destroys anything, destroys itself. Evolution is an attack upon thought itself. If evolution destroys anything, it does not destroy religion, but rationalism.

Evolution is an attack, not upon the faith, but upon the mind; you cannot think, if there are no things to think about. And if there is nothing to think about other than the random movements of atoms, of which your mind is also comprised, what is there left to think about? – G.K. Chesterton

The Truth of Christ’s Claims
============================

*I am the First and the Last. I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever!* - Revelation 1:17–18, NIV

The most natural explanation of Christ is the supernatural. If he was good, he was God. The people who knew him believed him to be good.  Here are the words of C.S. Lewis:

    *His legislation extended to the inmost motives of action, and covered in its wide sweep all the particulars of conduct. In the Sermon on the Mount he spoke with an authority which was expressly contrasted with that of all previous lawgivers…. He laid claim to the absolute allegiance of every soul. To those who complied, he promised blessedness in the life to come. There can be no doubt that he assumed to exercise the prerogative of pardoning sin. Apart from declarations, uttered in an authoritative tone, of the terms on which God would forgive sin, he assured individuals of the pardon of transgressions. He taught that his death stood in the closest relation to the remission of sins. He uttered, there is no reason to doubt, the largest predictions concerning the prospective growth of his spiritual empire. The government of the world would be shaped with reference to this end.* - C.S. Lewis

One wrong word or act would have destroyed Christ’s claims to be God, but **there was none**. - Des Ford, with C.S. Lewis

The Grace of the Lord Jesus is With You
=======================================
*The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.* - Revelation 22:21, NKJV

The Bible closes with this blessing. It is a summary of all of the blessings that God has promised us. Grace abounding! Divine favor, unbought, unsolicited, and undeserved! The Bible begins and ends with this.

This is the 'good news' which the Cross of Christ has made available; the 'good news' which remains 'good' to the last, unchanged by the lapse of time. The free love of God, coming to us through His Son, has not been exhausted.

This grace has been shown to us in many ways, but mainly in the Cross. The Cross did not originate grace, but it made it a righteous thing for us to receive.
When Jesus said "it is finished" as he died on the Cross, he broke down the barriers that stood between the sinner and the grace. This grace flows everywhere throughout a guilty earth; but its centre is the Cross; and only in connection with the Cross is it available to us.

We accept this grace simply by taking it as it is, and as we are; by letting it flow into us; by believing what God says about it. Grace does not ask us to prepare to receive it, in fact we must be worthless and guilty. If we needed to be anything else before receiving it, grace would be not grace. – Horatius Bonar
