The Nature of God
*****************


Never Be Cast Out
=================
*Whoever comes to me I will never cast out.* – John 6:37, ESV.
 
Is there any instance of our Lord's casting out one who came to him? If there be so, we would like to know of it; but there has been none, and there never will be. Among the lost souls in hell there is not one that can say, "I went to Jesus, and He refused me." It is not possible that you or I should be the first to whom Jesus shall break His word. Let us not entertain so dark a suspicion.
 
Suppose we go to Jesus now about the evils of today. Oh, this we may be sure—He will not refuse us audience or cast us out. Those of us who have often been and those who have never gone before—let us go together, and we shall see that He will not shut the door of His grace in the face of any one of us.
 
"This man receiveth sinners," but He repulses none. We come to Him in weakness and sin, with trembling faith, and small knowledge, and slender hope; but He does not cast us out. We come by prayer, and that prayer broken; with confession, and that confession faulty; with praise, and that praise far short of His merits; but yet He receives us. We come diseased, polluted, worn out, and worthless; but He doth in no wise cast us out. Let us come again today to Him who never casts us out. – Charles Spurgeon

God Freely Gives
================
*He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?* - Romans 8:32
 
If this is not a promise in form, it is in fact. Indeed, it is more than one promise, it is a conglomerate of promises. It is a mass of rubies, and emeralds, and diamonds, with a nugget of gold for their setting.
 
What can the Lord deny us after giving us Jesus? …If we need all things in heaven and earth, He will grant them to us: for if there had been a limit anywhere, He would have kept back His own Son.
 
What do I want today? I have only to ask for it. I may seek earnestly, but not as if I had to use pressure and extort an unwilling gift from the Lord's hand; for He will give freely. Of His own He gave us His own Son. Certainly no one would have proposed such a gift to Him. No one would have ventured to ask for it. It would have been too presumptuous.
 
He freely gave His Only-begotten, and, O my soul, can you not trust your heavenly Father to give you anything, to give you everything? Thy poor prayer would have no force with Omnipotence if force were needed; but His love, like a spring, rises of itself and overflows for the supply of all your needs. – Charles Spurgeon

The Son Shed His Blood For You
==============================
*When I see the blood, I will pass over you.* - Exodus 12:13

Even when I am unable to behold it, the Lord looks at the previous blood and passes over me because of it. If I am not so much at ease as I ought to be, because my faith is dim, yet I am equally safe because the Lord's eye is not dim, and He sees the blood of the great Sacrifice with steady gaze. What a joy is this!
 
The Lord sees the deep inner meaning, the infinite fullness of all that is meant by the death of His dear Son. He sees it with restful memory of justice satisfied, and all His matchless attributes glorified.
 
He beheld creation in its progress and said, "It is very good"; but what does He say of redemption in its completeness? What does He say of the obedience even unto death of His well-beloved Son? None can tell of His delight in Jesus, His rest in the sweet savor which Jesus presented when He offered Himself without spot unto God.
 
Now rest we in calm security. We have God's sacrifice and God's Word to create in us a sense of perfect security. He will, He must, pass over us, because He spared not our glorious Substitute. Justice joins hands with love to provide everlasting salvation for all those who are blood-sprinkled. – Charles Spurgeon

The Messiah Was Cut Off For You
===============================
*The Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself.* - Daniel 9:26

Rivers of tears, mountains of offerings, seas of bullocks' blood, and hills of frankincense, could not have availed for the removal of sin; but Jesus was cut off for us, and ... sin was put away forever. Herein is wisdom, whereby substitution, the sure and speedy way of atonement, was devised! Herein is condescension, which brought Messiah, the Prince, to wear a crown of thorns, and die upon the Cross! Herein is love, which led the Redeemer to lay down His life for His enemies!
 
It is not enough, however, to admire the spectacle of the innocent bleeding for the guilty, we must make sure of our interest therein ... Have we a part and a lot among those for whom He gave His life a ransom? Did the Lord Jesus stand as our representative? Are we healed by His stripes?
 
Solemn as the question is ... it is one that may be answered clearly and without mistake. To all who believe on Him, the Lord Jesus is a present Saviour, and upon them all the blood of reconciliation has been sprinkled. Let all who trust in the merit of Messiah's death be joyful at every remembrance of Him, and let their holy gratitude lead them to the fullest consecration to His cause. – Charles Spurgeon

You Are Perfectly Saved
=======================
*God ... has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began.* - 2 Timothy 1:9, NKJV

The apostle uses the perfect tense, meaning that this has already happened: "Who has saved us." Believers in Christ Jesus are saved. They are not looked upon as persons who are in a hopeful state, and may ultimately be saved, but they are already saved.
 
Salvation is not a blessing to be enjoyed on your deathbed, or to be enjoyed in some future life above, but something you can have now; received, promised, and enjoyed now. The Christian is perfectly saved according to God's plan. The price of salvation has already been paid: "It is finished" was the cry of the Saviour before he died. The believer is also perfectly saved in God’s covenant promise: Adam and Eve’s sin was our sin, and our life is now in Jesus Christ.
 
This complete salvation is accompanied by a holy calling. God did not choose us or call us because we were already holy, but he called us so we could be holy, and holiness is the beauty produced by God’s workmanship in us.
 
Salvation must be of grace, because the Lord is the author of it: and what motive but grace could motivate him to save the guilty? Salvation must be of grace, because Jesus covers all our guilt and unrighteousness. – Charles Spurgeon

We are Joint Heirs ...
======================
... **With Christ in His Kingdom**

*... joint heirs with Christ.* - Romans 8:17
 
The boundless realms of His Father's universe are Christ's by prescriptive right. As "heir of all things," ... He has admitted us to claim the whole as ours, by virtue of that deed of joint-heirship that the Lord has ratified with His chosen people.

The golden streets of paradise, the pearly gates, the river of life, the transcendent bliss, and the unutterable glory, are, by our blessed Lord, made over to us for our everlasting possession. All that He has He shares with His people.

He uncrowned Himself that we might have a coronation of glory; He would not sit upon His own throne until He had procured a place upon it for all who overcome by His blood ... Christ deems His happiness completed by His people sharing it.

    *"The glory which thou gavest me have I given them."*
    
    *"These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full."*

The smiles of His Father are all the sweeter to Him, because His people share them. The honours of His kingdom are more pleasing, because His people appear with Him in glory. He delights the more in His joy, because He calls them to enter into it. – Charles Spurgeon

Jesus Intercedes For Us
=======================
*I have prayed for you.* - Luke 22:32
 
How encouraging is the thought of the Redeemer's never-ceasing intercession for us. When we pray, he pleads for us; and when we are not praying, he is advocating our cause, and by his supplications shielding us from unseen dangers. Notice the word of comfort addressed to Peter: "Simon, Simon, Satan wants to have you so he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not."
 
We little know what we owe to our Saviour's prayers. When we reach the hilltops of heaven, and can review our lives to see how the Lord our God has led us, we will truly be able to praise him for guiding us and for undoing much of the mischief which Satan was attempting to do on earth. Then we will be able to thank him for his untiring care of us, and for his constant intercession with God on our behalf.
 
Even before Satan has begun to tempt, Jesus interrupts him and enters a plea in heaven. Mercy outruns malice….
 
O Jesus, what a comfort it is that you have pleaded our cause against our unseen enemies; countermined their mines, and unmasked their ambushes. Here is a matter for joy, gratitude, hope, and confidence. – Charles Spurgeon

How Shall We Live?
******************

Gaining By Giving
=================
*A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.* – Prov 11:25
 
If I desire to flourish in soul, I must not hoard up my stores but must distribute to the poor. To be close and niggardly is the world's way to prosperity, but it is not God's way, for He saith, "There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, and it tendeth to poverty."
 
Faith's way of gaining is giving. I must try this again and again, and I may expect that as much of prosperity as will be good for me will come to me as a gracious reward for a liberal course of action.
 
Of course, I may not be sure of growing rich. I shall be fat but not too fat… No, if I am fat enough to be healthy, I may well be satisfied; and if the Lord grants me a competence, I may be thoroughly content.
 
But there is a mental and spiritual fatness which I would greatly covet, and this comes as the result of generous thoughts toward my God, His church, and my fellow men. Let me not stint, lest I starve my heart. Let me be bountiful and liberal, for so shall I be like my Lord. He gave Himself for me; shall I grudge Him anything? – Charles Spurgeon

Pray That Christ’s Kingdom ...
==============================
... **May Be Extended**

*He shall see His seed; He shall prolong His days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand.* - Isaiah 53:10

    *Plead for the speedy fulfillment of this promise, all you who love the Lord ... How can He that gave the word refuse to keep it? Immutable veracity cannot demean itself by a lie, and eternal faithfulness cannot degrade itself by neglect ...*
 
That which the Spirit prompts us to ask for Jesus, is that which God decrees to give Him. Whenever you are praying for the kingdom of Christ, let your eyes behold the dawning of the blessed day which draweth near, when the Crucified shall receive His coronation… Your eyes cannot see the blissful future: borrow the telescope of faith; wipe the misty breath of your doubts from the glass; look through it and behold the coming glory.
 
Remember that the same Christ who tells us to say, "Give us this day our daily bread," had first given us this petition, "…Thy kingdom come…” Let not your prayers be all concerning your own sins, your own wants, your own imperfections, your own trials, but let them climb the starry ladder, and get up to Christ Himself, and then, as you draw nigh to the blood-sprinkled mercy-seat, offer this prayer continually, "Lord, extend the kingdom of Thy dear Son." Such a petition, fervently presented, will elevate the spirit of all your devotions. – Charles Spurgeon

God Loves To Hear You ...
=========================
... **Claim His Promises**

*Do as thou hast said.* - 2 Samuel 7:25, KJV

God’s promises were never meant to be thrown away like waste paper; he intended that they should be used. God's gold is not miser's money; it should not be hoarded, but used. Nothing pleases our Lord better than to see his promises put in circulation; he loves to see his children bring them up to him, and say, "Lord, please do as you promised."
 
Do you think that God will be any the poorer for giving you the riches he has promised? Do you think that he will be less holy because he offers his holiness to you? Do you imagine he will be any the less pure for washing aways your sins? Our Lord replies, "Your request is granted." Our heavenly Banker delights to cash his own notes.
 
Never think that God will be offended if you remind him of his promises. He loves to hear needy souls cry out to him. It is his delight to bestow favours. He is more ready to hear than you are to ask. The sun never gets tired of shining, and the fountain happily continues to flow. It is God's nature to keep his promises; so you can go confidently to him in prayer, asking "Do as you have promised." – Charles Spurgeon

We Look At Things That Are Not Seen
===================================
*We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.* - 2 Corinthians 4:18 KJV

In our Christian pilgrimage it is good, for the most part, to be looking forward. Forward lies the crown, and onward is the goal. Whether it be for hope, for joy, for consolation, or for the inspiring of our love, the future must, after all, be the grand object of the eye of faith.
 
Looking into the future we see sin cast out, the body of sin and death destroyed, the soul made perfect, and fit to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light. Looking further yet, the believer's enlightened eye can see beyond death to a light-filled eternity; he sees himself enter the heavenly gates, hailed as “more than conqueror,” crowned by the hand of Christ, embraced in the arms of Jesus, glorified with him, and permitted “to sit together with him on his throne, even as he has overcome and has sat down with the Father on his throne.”
 
The joys of heaven will surely compensate for the sorrows of earth. So let us not doubt! Death is just a narrow stream. Time, how short—eternity, how long! Death, how brief—immortality, how endless! – Charles Spurgeon

Faith Leads to Obedience
========================
*Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.* - Romans 3:31, KJV

When the believer is adopted into the Lord's family, his relationship to old Adam and the law ceases at once; then he is under a new rule, and a new covenant. Believer, you are God's child; it is your first duty to obey your heavenly Father.

Does he instruct his people to love one another? Do it, not because the law says, "Love your neighbour," but because Jesus says, "If you love me, keep my commandments;" and this is the commandment that he has given unto you, "that you love one another."

Are you told to give to the poor? Do it, not because charity is a burden that you dare not shirk, but because Jesus teaches, "Give to those who are needy."

Does the Bible say, "Love God with all your heart"? Look at the commandment and reply, "Ah! That’s a commandment! Jesus fulfilled all the commandments on the Cross. I have no need, therefore, to fulfill this or any other commandment in order to be saved, but I rejoice to love God because he is my Father and Redeemer now and I belong to him."

May the Holy Ghost make your heart obedient to the constraining power of Christ's love. Grace is the mother and nurse of holiness, and not the defender of sin. – Charles Spurgeon

Care For The Poor
=================
*Remember the poor.* - Galatians 2:10, KJV

Why does God allow so many of his children to be poor? He could make them all rich if he pleased. There is no necessity that they should be poor, except that he allows it. He could supply them, but he does not choose to do so; he allows them to suffer want, he allows them to remain poor and unnoticed. Why is this?

We can never understand God’s reasons fully. However, I believe that one reason is to give us, who are favoured with enough, an opportunity of demonstrating our love for Jesus. If there were no needy people in the world, we would not have the privilege of demonstrating our Christian love, by ministering with our gifts.

It may be that God has given us this opportunity to prove that our love for him is more than words, and that it extends to our fellow men as well — a love not in word only, but in deed and in truth.

If we truly love Christ, those who are dear to him will be dear to us also. That extends to “the world”, for we are reminded that “God so loved the world ...”.

So let us consider it a privilege, not a duty, to help the poor of the Lord’s flock — remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, “Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me.” All we do for his people is graciously accepted by Christ as done to himself. – Charles Spurgeon

Communion And Service
=====================
*Martha was distracted with all her preparations...* - Luke 10:40, NASB

Martha’s fault was not that she was preparing and serving the meal: it is a good thing for every Christian to serve others. In fact, “I serve” should be the motto of all the princes of the royal family of heaven. And it was not Martha’s fault that she had “much serving” (KJV). We cannot do too much. Let us do all that we possibly can  in the Master’s service. It was a great privilege to be busy preparing a feast for the Master. How fortunate she was to have an opportunity of entertaining so blessed a guest; and fortunate, too, to have the spirit to throw her whole soul so heartily into the task.

Martha’s fault was that she grew “distracted with all her preparations”, so that she forgot the Master, and only remembered the preparations. She allowed her service to override communion, so her service did not have the blessing of her communion with Jesus.

The lesson of this story is that we should be Martha and Mary in one: we should do much service, and have much communion at the same time. For this we need great grace. It is easier to be busy and to serve than to commune.

If we are to be truly useful in God’s service in this life, we must keep ourselves in constant communion with the Lord Jesus; we must ensure that the vital spirituality of our religion is maintained over and above everything else in the world. – Charles Spurgeon

The Eternal God is Your Helper
==============================
*I will help you, says the Lord.* - Isaiah 41:14, NKJV

This morning let us hear the Lord Jesus speak to each one of us: “I will help you,” he says.

Here are some of the other things he would say to us if we listen to him through his word:

    *“It is easy for Me, your God, to help you. Consider what I have done already. Why, I bought you with My blood. I have died for you; and if I have done these great things, why wouldn’t I do smaller things for you? I can do so much for you, and I will do even more."*

    *"Before the world began, I chose you. I made the covenant for you. I laid aside My glory and became a man for you; I gave up My life for you; and if I did all this, I will surely help you now… Do you need more strength than the omnipotence of God? Do you want more wisdom than exists in God the Father, more love than his Son has showed to us, or more power than the Holy Spirit has to work in your life?"*

Bring everything to God — your sadness and loneliness, your troubles, your needs. See how full God’s river of blessing is for you, so full that you don’t need anything else. You can be strong in God, because he is your helper! – Charles Spurgeon

How to Enjoy Peace With God
===========================
*Father, I have sinned.* – Luke 15:18 KJV

Those whom Christ has washed in his precious blood no longer stand where they can be condemned, but are once for all “accepted in the Beloved”. They are God’s precious children. But even children offend, so it is good for them to be in the habit of going every day to their heavenly Father to confess their sin, and acknowledge the sinfulness in their character.

If you do not develop this daily habit: what will be the consequences? You will feel at a distance from him; you will begin to doubt his love for you; you will grow like the prodigal son, who, although still his father’s child, was so far away from his father.

But if you acknowledge your mistakes, and are sorry for offending so gracious and loving a Parent; if you go to him and tell him all, and accept his forgiveness, then you will feel restored to a close, loving relationship with God. You will go through your Christian life knowing you are saved, and also enjoying present peace in God through Jesus Christ your Lord.

We have been cleansed once for all, but our feet still need to be washed from the defilement of our daily walk as children of God.  – Charles Spurgeon

The Kingdom of Heaven ...
=========================
... **is for the Peacemakers**

*Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.* - Matthew 5:9, NIV

This is the seventh of the beatitudes: and seven was the number of perfection among the Hebrews. Whoever desires perfect blessedness, so far as it can be enjoyed on earth, must reach this seventh blessing, and become a peacemaker. There is a significance also in the position of the text. The verse which precedes it speaks of the blessedness of “the pure in heart” (v.8).  Our peacefulness is never to be a toleration of evil.

The verse that follows also seems to have been put there on purpose.

    *“Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness.”* v.10

However peaceable we may be in this world, we will still be misrepresented and misunderstood. Even the Prince of Peace himself was “despised and rejected of men.” In this way, the peacemakers are not blessed, but they are surrounded, before and after, with blessings.

Let us pray for grace to climb to this seventh beatitude! Let us ask the Lord to purify our minds so we may be “first pure, then peaceable” (James 3:17), and to fortify our souls, that our peaceableness may not lead us into cowardice and despair, when we are persecuted for Christ’s sake. – Charles Spurgeon
