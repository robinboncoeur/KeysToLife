The Nature of God
*****************


Never Be Cast Out
=================
*Whoever comes to me I will never cast out.* – John 6:37, ESV.
 
Is there any instance of our Lord's casting out one who came to him? If there be so, we would like to know of it; but there has been none, and there never will be. Among the lost souls in hell there is not one that can say, "I went to Jesus, and He refused me." It is not possible that you or I should be the first to whom Jesus shall break His word. Let us not entertain so dark a suspicion.
 
Suppose we go to Jesus now about the evils of today. Oh, this we may be sure—He will not refuse us audience or cast us out. Those of us who have often been and those who have never gone before—let us go together, and we shall see that He will not shut the door of His grace in the face of any one of us.
 
"This man receiveth sinners," but He repulses none. We come to Him in weakness and sin, with trembling faith, and small knowledge, and slender hope; but He does not cast us out. We come by prayer, and that prayer broken; with confession, and that confession faulty; with praise, and that praise far short of His merits; but yet He receives us. We come diseased, polluted, worn out, and worthless; but He doth in no wise cast us out. Let us come again today to Him who never casts us out. – Charles Spurgeon

God Freely Gives
================
*He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?* - Romans 8:32
 
If this is not a promise in form, it is in fact. Indeed, it is more than one promise, it is a conglomerate of promises. It is a mass of rubies, and emeralds, and diamonds, with a nugget of gold for their setting.
 
What can the Lord deny us after giving us Jesus? …If we need all things in heaven and earth, He will grant them to us: for if there had been a limit anywhere, He would have kept back His own Son.
 
What do I want today? I have only to ask for it. I may seek earnestly, but not as if I had to use pressure and extort an unwilling gift from the Lord's hand; for He will give freely. Of His own He gave us His own Son. Certainly no one would have proposed such a gift to Him. No one would have ventured to ask for it. It would have been too presumptuous.
 
He freely gave His Only-begotten, and, O my soul, can you not trust your heavenly Father to give you anything, to give you everything? Thy poor prayer would have no force with Omnipotence if force were needed; but His love, like a spring, rises of itself and overflows for the supply of all your needs. – Charles Spurgeon

The Son Shed His Blood For You
==============================
*When I see the blood, I will pass over you.* - Exodus 12:13

Even when I am unable to behold it, the Lord looks at the previous blood and passes over me because of it. If I am not so much at ease as I ought to be, because my faith is dim, yet I am equally safe because the Lord's eye is not dim, and He sees the blood of the great Sacrifice with steady gaze. What a joy is this!
 
The Lord sees the deep inner meaning, the infinite fullness of all that is meant by the death of His dear Son. He sees it with restful memory of justice satisfied, and all His matchless attributes glorified.
 
He beheld creation in its progress and said, "It is very good"; but what does He say of redemption in its completeness? What does He say of the obedience even unto death of His well-beloved Son? None can tell of His delight in Jesus, His rest in the sweet savor which Jesus presented when He offered Himself without spot unto God.
 
Now rest we in calm security. We have God's sacrifice and God's Word to create in us a sense of perfect security. He will, He must, pass over us, because He spared not our glorious Substitute. Justice joins hands with love to provide everlasting salvation for all those who are blood-sprinkled. – Charles Spurgeon

The Messiah Was Cut Off For You
===============================
*The Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself.* - Daniel 9:26

Rivers of tears, mountains of offerings, seas of bullocks' blood, and hills of frankincense, could not have availed for the removal of sin; but Jesus was cut off for us, and ... sin was put away forever. Herein is wisdom, whereby substitution, the sure and speedy way of atonement, was devised! Herein is condescension, which brought Messiah, the Prince, to wear a crown of thorns, and die upon the Cross! Herein is love, which led the Redeemer to lay down His life for His enemies!
 
It is not enough, however, to admire the spectacle of the innocent bleeding for the guilty, we must make sure of our interest therein ... Have we a part and a lot among those for whom He gave His life a ransom? Did the Lord Jesus stand as our representative? Are we healed by His stripes?
 
Solemn as the question is ... it is one that may be answered clearly and without mistake. To all who believe on Him, the Lord Jesus is a present Saviour, and upon them all the blood of reconciliation has been sprinkled. Let all who trust in the merit of Messiah's death be joyful at every remembrance of Him, and let their holy gratitude lead them to the fullest consecration to His cause. – Charles Spurgeon

You Are Perfectly Saved
=======================
*God ... has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began.* - 2 Timothy 1:9, NKJV

The apostle uses the perfect tense, meaning that this has already happened: "Who has saved us." Believers in Christ Jesus are saved. They are not looked upon as persons who are in a hopeful state, and may ultimately be saved, but they are already saved.
 
Salvation is not a blessing to be enjoyed on your deathbed, or to be enjoyed in some future life above, but something you can have now; received, promised, and enjoyed now. The Christian is perfectly saved according to God's plan. The price of salvation has already been paid: "It is finished" was the cry of the Saviour before he died. The believer is also perfectly saved in God’s covenant promise: Adam and Eve’s sin was our sin, and our life is now in Jesus Christ.
 
This complete salvation is accompanied by a holy calling. God did not choose us or call us because we were already holy, but he called us so we could be holy, and holiness is the beauty produced by God’s workmanship in us.
 
Salvation must be of grace, because the Lord is the author of it: and what motive but grace could motivate him to save the guilty? Salvation must be of grace, because Jesus covers all our guilt and unrighteousness. – Charles Spurgeon

We are Joint Heirs ...
======================
... **With Christ in His Kingdom**

*... joint heirs with Christ.* - Romans 8:17
 
The boundless realms of His Father's universe are Christ's by prescriptive right. As "heir of all things," ... He has admitted us to claim the whole as ours, by virtue of that deed of joint-heirship that the Lord has ratified with His chosen people.

The golden streets of paradise, the pearly gates, the river of life, the transcendent bliss, and the unutterable glory, are, by our blessed Lord, made over to us for our everlasting possession. All that He has He shares with His people.

He uncrowned Himself that we might have a coronation of glory; He would not sit upon His own throne until He had procured a place upon it for all who overcome by His blood ... Christ deems His happiness completed by His people sharing it.

    *"The glory which thou gavest me have I given them."*
    
    *"These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full."*

The smiles of His Father are all the sweeter to Him, because His people share them. The honours of His kingdom are more pleasing, because His people appear with Him in glory. He delights the more in His joy, because He calls them to enter into it. – Charles Spurgeon

Jesus Intercedes For Us
=======================
*I have prayed for you.* - Luke 22:32
 
How encouraging is the thought of the Redeemer's never-ceasing intercession for us. When we pray, he pleads for us; and when we are not praying, he is advocating our cause, and by his supplications shielding us from unseen dangers. Notice the word of comfort addressed to Peter: "Simon, Simon, Satan wants to have you so he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not."
 
We little know what we owe to our Saviour's prayers. When we reach the hilltops of heaven, and can review our lives to see how the Lord our God has led us, we will truly be able to praise him for guiding us and for undoing much of the mischief which Satan was attempting to do on earth. Then we will be able to thank him for his untiring care of us, and for his constant intercession with God on our behalf.
 
Even before Satan has begun to tempt, Jesus interrupts him and enters a plea in heaven. Mercy outruns malice….
 
O Jesus, what a comfort it is that you have pleaded our cause against our unseen enemies; countermined their mines, and unmasked their ambushes. Here is a matter for joy, gratitude, hope, and confidence. – Charles Spurgeon

God Always Hears You
====================

*My God will hear me.* - Micah 7:7

Friends may be unfaithful, but the Lord will not turn away from anyone who comes to him; on the contrary, He will listen to all your sincere desires. The prophet says, "Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. A man's enemies are the men of his own house." This is a wretched state of affairs; but even when other people hurt us, Jesus, our Best Friend remains true, and we may tell Him all our grief.
 
Our wisdom is to look unto the Lord and not to quarrel with other people. If our loving appeals are disregarded by our relatives, let us wait upon the God of our salvation, for He will hear us. He will hear us all the more because of the unkindness and oppression of others, and we shall soon have reason to cry, "Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy!"
 
Because God is the living God, He can hear; because He is a loving God, He will hear; because He is our covenant God, He has bound Himself to hear us. We can confidently call him "My God," and we can be absolutely certain that, "My God will hear me." So, when you are suffering, tell God about your sorrows! You can confidently say, "My God will hear me." – Charles Spurgeon

God is in Control
=================

*The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord.* - Proverbs 16:33, NKJV

This text refers to how the people of old would cast lots (like throwing dice) to determine what to do. If the simple casting of a lot is guided by the Lord, how much more the events of our entire life?

Our blessed Saviour tells us:

    *“Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father’s will. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.”*
    
If you always remembered this, you would be free from anxiety, and you would be able to walk in patience, quiet, and cheerfulness.
 
If you would “seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,” all things would then be given to you. When you fret and stress about your own circumstances, you are meddling with Christ’s business. You are trying to do the work of “providing” and you forget that your work is just to obey. Be wise and focus on the obeying, and let Christ manage the providing.
 
Look at your heavenly Father’s heart of mercy; how could he ever be unkind! Look at his infinite wisdom; how could it ever fail? Your heavenly Father, who remembers even the sparrows, will never forget the least of his poor children. – Charles H. Spurgeon

God is Your Father
==================

*You are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.* - Galatians 3:26, KJV

It is the privilege of all God’s children to call him Father. Perhaps you think you have little faith. Perhaps you want to be full of courage to face the challenges of life, but you stumble at every step, and even shadows make you afraid.

You should think about this: the weakest Christian is as much a child of God as the strongest one. God, our heavenly Father, has the same tender heart towards all. One may do more mighty works, but the person whose name is the least in the kingdom of heaven is as much the child of God as the one who stands among the mightiest in the Kingdom of God. Let this truth encourage and comfort us, when we come to God and say, “Our Father.”’

However, let us not be content with weak faith, but ask, like the Apostles, to have it increased. However weak our faith may be, if it is real faith in Christ, we will reach heaven at last. However, a stronger faith will bring more honour to our Master, and we will be filled with greater joy and peace.

If it is your desire to live for Christ’s glory, then seek to be filled with the spirit of adoption more and more completely. The Spirit of God will cast out fear. –  Charles H. Spurgeon

God Will Lead You ...
=====================
... **on the Right Path**

*He led them forth by the right path.* - Psalm 107:7, NKJV

The ups and downs of our lives mean that believers sometimes ask, “Why do these things keep happening to me?”

The ups and downs of your faith, the fainting of your hope, all these things are really just God’s method of making you ready for the great inheritance which you will soon receive. The purpose of these trials is for the testing and strengthening of your faith. They are waves that wash you further upon the rock; they are winds that send your ship  more swiftly towards your desired haven (Psalm 107:30).

The health of your soul is maintained through honour and dishonour, by the evil things that are said of you and by the good, by plenty and by poverty, by joy and by distress, by persecution and by peace.

Don’t think, believer, that your troubles are outside of God’s plan. They are necessary parts of it. “We must, through much tribulation, enter the kingdom.” We must learn to understand our troubles in the right way, and to “count it all joy when you fall into various trials.”

Let your trembling soul be still. Even though we may not always see God’s purpose, believe that all will be well, because all is ruled by him. – Charles H. Spurgeon

Wait for the Gates ...
======================
... **of Heaven to Open**

*All the days of my appointed time will I wait.* - Job 14:14, KJV

A little stay on earth will make heaven more heavenly. Nothing makes rest so sweet as work; nothing makes safety so pleasant as exposure to danger. Jesus was baptised with a baptism of suffering among humanity, and we must be baptised with the same if we would share his kingdom. The honour of fellowship with Christ is so great, that the greatest sorrow is a light thing to go through in order to have it.

Another reason why we wait here on earth is for the good of others. Our work is not yet done. We are called to give light to souls who wander in darkness in the wilderness of sin. Our wait here is also for God’s glory. A saint who has been tried, like a well-cut diamond, glitters brightly in the King’s crown. We are God’s workmanship, in whom he will be glorified by our afflictions.

It is for the honour of Jesus that we endure the trial of our faith with sacred joy. Let each person surrender his own desires to the glory of Jesus. Our time here on earth is fixed and decided by God. Let us not be anxious about it, but wait with patience till the gates of pearl shall open. – Charles H. Spurgeon

God is For Us
=============

*When I cry out to You, Then my enemies will turn back; this I know; for God is for me.* - Psalm 56:9, NKJV

It is impossible for any human speech to express the full meaning of this wonderful phrase, “God is for me.” He was “for us” before the worlds were made. He was “for us” when we were ruined in the fall—he loved us despite it all; he was “for us,” when we were rebels against him. He was “for us,” or he would not have given his beloved Son.

He has been “for us” in our many struggles, whether dangers or temptations. Where would we be today if he had not been “for us”? He is “for us,” with all the infinity of his being; with all the omnipotence of his love; with all the infallibility of his wisdom.

Because he is “for us,” when we pray, he will always help. This is not some vague hope, but a well-grounded assurance— the Psalmist says “this I know.”

He is “for us,” — eternally and irrevocably “for us”. If you have such a God, then how happy you are with the King of Kings on your side! How safe with such a Protector! How overwhelmingly will your cause be pled by such an Advocate! If God be for you, who can be against you? – Charles Spurgeon

Where Your Great Strength Lies
==============================

*Tell me where your great strength lies.* - Judges 16:6, NKJV

Where lies the secret strength of faith? It lies in what it feeds on; for faith focuses on the source of the promises of God – an overflowing of divine grace from the great heart of God.

Faith doesn’t consider the size of the promise, for all of God’s promises are great. Instead, faith asks, “Who is its author?” Faith remembers that it is God, who cannot lie. As a result, faith is able to move forward with conviction.

Faith remembers why God’s promises are given, for God’s glory, and because of his love and grace. Faith looks at the amazing work of Christ as clear proof of the Father’s intention to fulfil his word:

    *He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?* Romans 8:32
 
Faith also looks back on the past, and her past victories give her courage. She remembers that God never has failed her, and that he has never failed any of his children. (See 1 Samuel 7:12, NKJV). Because of this faith can say with confidence,

    *Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life* Psalm 23:6
 
– Charles Spurgeon

How Shall We Live?
******************

Gaining By Giving
=================
*A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.* – Prov 11:25
 
If I desire to flourish in soul, I must not hoard up my stores but must distribute to the poor. To be close and niggardly is the world's way to prosperity, but it is not God's way, for He saith, "There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, and it tendeth to poverty."
 
Faith's way of gaining is giving. I must try this again and again, and I may expect that as much of prosperity as will be good for me will come to me as a gracious reward for a liberal course of action.
 
Of course, I may not be sure of growing rich. I shall be fat but not too fat… No, if I am fat enough to be healthy, I may well be satisfied; and if the Lord grants me a competence, I may be thoroughly content.
 
But there is a mental and spiritual fatness which I would greatly covet, and this comes as the result of generous thoughts toward my God, His church, and my fellow men. Let me not stint, lest I starve my heart. Let me be bountiful and liberal, for so shall I be like my Lord. He gave Himself for me; shall I grudge Him anything? – Charles Spurgeon

Pray That Christ’s Kingdom ...
==============================
... **May Be Extended**

*He shall see His seed; He shall prolong His days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand.* - Isaiah 53:10

    *Plead for the speedy fulfillment of this promise, all you who love the Lord ... How can He that gave the word refuse to keep it? Immutable veracity cannot demean itself by a lie, and eternal faithfulness cannot degrade itself by neglect ...*
 
That which the Spirit prompts us to ask for Jesus, is that which God decrees to give Him. Whenever you are praying for the kingdom of Christ, let your eyes behold the dawning of the blessed day which draweth near, when the Crucified shall receive His coronation… Your eyes cannot see the blissful future: borrow the telescope of faith; wipe the misty breath of your doubts from the glass; look through it and behold the coming glory.
 
Remember that the same Christ who tells us to say, "Give us this day our daily bread," had first given us this petition, "…Thy kingdom come…” Let not your prayers be all concerning your own sins, your own wants, your own imperfections, your own trials, but let them climb the starry ladder, and get up to Christ Himself, and then, as you draw nigh to the blood-sprinkled mercy-seat, offer this prayer continually, "Lord, extend the kingdom of Thy dear Son." Such a petition, fervently presented, will elevate the spirit of all your devotions. – Charles Spurgeon

God Loves To Hear You ...
=========================
... **Claim His Promises**

*Do as thou hast said.* - 2 Samuel 7:25, KJV

God’s promises were never meant to be thrown away like waste paper; he intended that they should be used. God's gold is not miser's money; it should not be hoarded, but used. Nothing pleases our Lord better than to see his promises put in circulation; he loves to see his children bring them up to him, and say, "Lord, please do as you promised."
 
Do you think that God will be any the poorer for giving you the riches he has promised? Do you think that he will be less holy because he offers his holiness to you? Do you imagine he will be any the less pure for washing aways your sins? Our Lord replies, "Your request is granted." Our heavenly Banker delights to cash his own notes.
 
Never think that God will be offended if you remind him of his promises. He loves to hear needy souls cry out to him. It is his delight to bestow favours. He is more ready to hear than you are to ask. The sun never gets tired of shining, and the fountain happily continues to flow. It is God's nature to keep his promises; so you can go confidently to him in prayer, asking "Do as you have promised." – Charles Spurgeon

We Look At Things That Are Not Seen
===================================
*We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.* - 2 Corinthians 4:18 KJV

In our Christian pilgrimage it is good, for the most part, to be looking forward. Forward lies the crown, and onward is the goal. Whether it be for hope, for joy, for consolation, or for the inspiring of our love, the future must, after all, be the grand object of the eye of faith.
 
Looking into the future we see sin cast out, the body of sin and death destroyed, the soul made perfect, and fit to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light. Looking further yet, the believer's enlightened eye can see beyond death to a light-filled eternity; he sees himself enter the heavenly gates, hailed as “more than conqueror,” crowned by the hand of Christ, embraced in the arms of Jesus, glorified with him, and permitted “to sit together with him on his throne, even as he has overcome and has sat down with the Father on his throne.”
 
The joys of heaven will surely compensate for the sorrows of earth. So let us not doubt! Death is just a narrow stream. Time, how short—eternity, how long! Death, how brief—immortality, how endless! – Charles Spurgeon

Faith Leads to Obedience
========================
*Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.* - Romans 3:31, KJV

When the believer is adopted into the Lord's family, his relationship to old Adam and the law ceases at once; then he is under a new rule, and a new covenant. Believer, you are God's child; it is your first duty to obey your heavenly Father.

Does he instruct his people to love one another? Do it, not because the law says, "Love your neighbour," but because Jesus says, "If you love me, keep my commandments;" and this is the commandment that he has given unto you, "that you love one another."

Are you told to give to the poor? Do it, not because charity is a burden that you dare not shirk, but because Jesus teaches, "Give to those who are needy."

Does the Bible say, "Love God with all your heart"? Look at the commandment and reply, "Ah! That’s a commandment! Jesus fulfilled all the commandments on the Cross. I have no need, therefore, to fulfill this or any other commandment in order to be saved, but I rejoice to love God because he is my Father and Redeemer now and I belong to him."

May the Holy Ghost make your heart obedient to the constraining power of Christ's love. Grace is the mother and nurse of holiness, and not the defender of sin. – Charles Spurgeon

Care For The Poor
=================
*Remember the poor.* - Galatians 2:10, KJV

Why does God allow so many of his children to be poor? He could make them all rich if he pleased. There is no necessity that they should be poor, except that he allows it. He could supply them, but he does not choose to do so; he allows them to suffer want, he allows them to remain poor and unnoticed. Why is this?

We can never understand God’s reasons fully. However, I believe that one reason is to give us, who are favoured with enough, an opportunity of demonstrating our love for Jesus. If there were no needy people in the world, we would not have the privilege of demonstrating our Christian love, by ministering with our gifts.

It may be that God has given us this opportunity to prove that our love for him is more than words, and that it extends to our fellow men as well — a love not in word only, but in deed and in truth.

If we truly love Christ, those who are dear to him will be dear to us also. That extends to “the world”, for we are reminded that “God so loved the world ...”.

So let us consider it a privilege, not a duty, to help the poor of the Lord’s flock — remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, “Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me.” All we do for his people is graciously accepted by Christ as done to himself. – Charles Spurgeon

Communion And Service
=====================
*Martha was distracted with all her preparations...* - Luke 10:40, NASB

Martha’s fault was not that she was preparing and serving the meal: it is a good thing for every Christian to serve others. In fact, “I serve” should be the motto of all the princes of the royal family of heaven. And it was not Martha’s fault that she had “much serving” (KJV). We cannot do too much. Let us do all that we possibly can  in the Master’s service. It was a great privilege to be busy preparing a feast for the Master. How fortunate she was to have an opportunity of entertaining so blessed a guest; and fortunate, too, to have the spirit to throw her whole soul so heartily into the task.

Martha’s fault was that she grew “distracted with all her preparations”, so that she forgot the Master, and only remembered the preparations. She allowed her service to override communion, so her service did not have the blessing of her communion with Jesus.

The lesson of this story is that we should be Martha and Mary in one: we should do much service, and have much communion at the same time. For this we need great grace. It is easier to be busy and to serve than to commune.

If we are to be truly useful in God’s service in this life, we must keep ourselves in constant communion with the Lord Jesus; we must ensure that the vital spirituality of our religion is maintained over and above everything else in the world. – Charles Spurgeon

The Eternal God is Your Helper
==============================
*I will help you, says the Lord.* - Isaiah 41:14, NKJV

This morning let us hear the Lord Jesus speak to each one of us: “I will help you,” he says.

Here are some of the other things he would say to us if we listen to him through his word:

    *“It is easy for Me, your God, to help you. Consider what I have done already. Why, I bought you with My blood. I have died for you; and if I have done these great things, why wouldn’t I do smaller things for you? I can do so much for you, and I will do even more."*

    *"Before the world began, I chose you. I made the covenant for you. I laid aside My glory and became a man for you; I gave up My life for you; and if I did all this, I will surely help you now… Do you need more strength than the omnipotence of God? Do you want more wisdom than exists in God the Father, more love than his Son has showed to us, or more power than the Holy Spirit has to work in your life?"*

Bring everything to God — your sadness and loneliness, your troubles, your needs. See how full God’s river of blessing is for you, so full that you don’t need anything else. You can be strong in God, because he is your helper! – Charles Spurgeon

How to Enjoy Peace With God
===========================
*Father, I have sinned.* – Luke 15:18 KJV

Those whom Christ has washed in his precious blood no longer stand where they can be condemned, but are once for all “accepted in the Beloved”. They are God’s precious children. But even children offend, so it is good for them to be in the habit of going every day to their heavenly Father to confess their sin, and acknowledge the sinfulness in their character.

If you do not develop this daily habit: what will be the consequences? You will feel at a distance from him; you will begin to doubt his love for you; you will grow like the prodigal son, who, although still his father’s child, was so far away from his father.

But if you acknowledge your mistakes, and are sorry for offending so gracious and loving a Parent; if you go to him and tell him all, and accept his forgiveness, then you will feel restored to a close, loving relationship with God. You will go through your Christian life knowing you are saved, and also enjoying present peace in God through Jesus Christ your Lord.

We have been cleansed once for all, but our feet still need to be washed from the defilement of our daily walk as children of God.  – Charles Spurgeon

The Kingdom of Heaven ...
=========================
... **is for the Peacemakers**

*Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.* - Matthew 5:9, NIV

This is the seventh of the beatitudes: and seven was the number of perfection among the Hebrews. Whoever desires perfect blessedness, so far as it can be enjoyed on earth, must reach this seventh blessing, and become a peacemaker. There is a significance also in the position of the text. The verse which precedes it speaks of the blessedness of “the pure in heart” (v.8).  Our peacefulness is never to be a toleration of evil.

The verse that follows also seems to have been put there on purpose.

    *“Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness.”* v.10

However peaceable we may be in this world, we will still be misrepresented and misunderstood. Even the Prince of Peace himself was “despised and rejected of men.” In this way, the peacemakers are not blessed, but they are surrounded, before and after, with blessings.

Let us pray for grace to climb to this seventh beatitude! Let us ask the Lord to purify our minds so we may be “first pure, then peaceable” (James 3:17), and to fortify our souls, that our peaceableness may not lead us into cowardice and despair, when we are persecuted for Christ’s sake. – Charles Spurgeon

Your Life Proves God to Others
==============================

*The only letter I need is you yourselves! By looking at the good change in your hearts, everyone can see that we have done a good work among you.* - 2 Corinthians 3:2, TLB

God wants all His children to be living examples of aspects of His character. I don’t think any one of the children of God proves all of God, but we all prove different parts of His one grand character.

The thief on the cross proved the patience of God. Mary Magdalene proved his pardoning grace. Job proved that God is able to sustain us amidst unparalleled sufferings.

However, we should not think that the testimony of the witnesses is closed. Each of God’s saints is sent into the world to prove some part of the Divine Character. Each Christian displays some attribute or other of God. When the whole is combined, like the sun that shines in all its splendour, we will see in Christian experience a beautiful revelation of our God!

In fact, we are able to prove all of God’s promises in our lifetimes. On the last great day, we will find that every one of them has been fulfilled! This is not just true for us individually, because all of God’s promises will also be fulfilled in the united experience of the Church. – Charles Spurgeon

To Live is Christ
=================

*For me to live is Christ.* - Philippians 1:21, NKJV

Paul’s words mean more than most men think; they imply that the aim and purpose of his life was Christ; even his life itself was Jesus. He ate, and drank, and slept eternal life. Jesus was his very breath, the soul of his soul, the heart of his heart, the life of his life.
 
Can you say, as a professing Christian, that you live up to this ideal? Can you honestly say that for you to live is Christ? Your business—are you doing it for Christ? Or are you doing it your own personal benefit and for the benefit of your family? Are you surprised if I say that these reasons are too shabby for doing your business? For a Christian they are. A Christian professes to live for Christ; how can he live for another purpose without committing spiritual adultery?

Many there are who carry out this principle in some degree; but who is there who dares to say that he lives entirely for Christ as the apostle did? Yet, this alone is the true life of a Christian—its source, its sustenance, its method, its purpose and goal, is all gathered up in one word—Christ Jesus. – Charles Spurgeon

How to Love Christ More
=======================

*We love him because He first loved us.* - 1 John 4:19, NKJV

We should love Christ much more than we do at present. Christ has spontaneously shown us such love when we were his enemies, that even if our every breath and pulse was devoted to him, if we had ten thousand lives and we laid them all down for him, we would be perfectly justified in doing that, and ten thousand times more, if it were possible.

Our love to our Lord Jesus Christ is an effect produced by a great cause, namely, his eternal love to us. If you really believe that he has loved you with such love, then you must love him, must you not? Can your heart resist his charms?

The heart that does not feel moved whenever the love of Christ is proclaimed must be a hard heart indeed. Yet we must not try to make ourselves love our Lord, but look to Christ's love first, for his love will create in us love towards him.

If you are distressed because you cannot love Christ as much as you would like to, then just forget your own love to him, and focus on his great love to you. The more you do this, the more your love will transform into what you desire it to be. - Charles Spurgeon

You Will Be Satisfied ...
=========================
... **by God’s Grace**

*They are abundantly satisfied with the fullness of Your house, And You give them drink from the river of Your pleasures.* - Psalm 36:8, NKJV

When the Queen of Sheba visited Solomon, she was astonished when she saw the food and the generosity that was shown to welcome her. But even this cannot be compared to the generosity of the grace of God!

Millions of God’s people are fed daily by his grace. Everyone comes hungry and thirsty, but no one leaves unsatisfied. There is enough of the grace of God for you, enough for all, and enough for ever. The Lord spreads his table, not for one, but many saints, not for one day, but for many years; not for many years only, but for generation after generation.

The text tells us that the guests at mercy’s banquet are even more than just “satisfied”; they are “abundantly satisfied.” This feasting is guaranteed by God’s faithful promise to every person who puts their trust in God.

I once thought that if I could only get the left-overs at God’s back door of grace I would be satisfied; like the woman who said, “The dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.” But no child of God is ever served with scraps and left-overs. Like Mephibosheth, they all eat from the king’s own table: such is the marvellous abundance of grace which God gives us to enjoy. – Charles H. Spurgeon

You Must Pass Through Tribulation ...
=====================================
... **to Enter the Kingdom of God**

*We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.* - Acts 14:22, KJV

Trials are a part of our lot in life. If we are Christ’s heirs, then he left trials to us in his legacy. So surely as the stars are fashioned by his hands, and their orbits fixed by him, so surely are our trials given to us.

Followers of Jesus must never expect to escape troubles. If they do, they will be disappointed, for none of their predecessors have been without them. Read the biographies of all the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and you will discover that everyone to whom God showed his mercy were made to pass through the fire of affliction.

In ancient times, a royal mark was placed on all the treasures that belonged to the king. The royal mark of the Cross distinguishes with honour all those who have received God’s mercy.

Although God’s children must walk through the path of tribulation, they have the comfort of knowing that their Master has walked this path before them. They have his presence and kindness to cheer them, his grace to support them, and his example to teach them how to endure.

When you have finally reached “the kingdom,” it will more than make amends for the “much tribulation” through which you passed to enter it. – Charles H. Spurgeon
