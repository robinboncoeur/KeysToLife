# True Keys To Life

No code here, this is a set of emailed devotionals from Good News Unlimited that I have found worth reading again and again, which is why I've compiled them to make them available to all. The gospel is available to all, and these words focus on the gospel of Jesus Christ, and what exactly that means to us humans. 

You can read the rst pages (RST = "restructured text") within the RST folder, or you can view those writings by Dr. Desmond Ford, pastors Eli Gonzalez and Charles Spurgeon on a nicely formatted, easy-to-navigate "Read-The-Docs" webpage:

**May these words prove as insprational and life-changing to you as they were to me.**
